<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> The Night Before Christmas......<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p> 'Twas the night before Christmas, an all through the block,<br>
  Not a creature was stirring, not even Ed Kotch.<br>
  The stockings were hung, by the furnace with care.<br>
  In hopes that by morning, they'd all still be there.</p>
<p>Me an this skank, were just getting ready for bed.<br>
  I wore pajamas, she had a paper bag for her head.<br>
  When up on the roof, I heard a big crash,<br>
  I thought it was a burglar, I was gonna kick ass!</p>
<p>I went out on the fire escape, looked up in the sky,<br>
  An what did I see, but this freakin fat guy!<br>
  With a red suit and boots, that came up to his knees,<br>
  In the moonlight he looked, just like Dom DeLouise.</p>
<p>He had a big sled, being pulled by reindeer.<br>
  He called one of them Dancer, so I assumed he was queer.<br>
  As he crept off the roof, it became clear to me,<br>
  That this guy was lookin, to steal my TV!</p>
<p>Over his shoulder, he had a big sack.<br>
  He came down the stairs, while I planned my attack.<br>
  I waited a second, till the time it seemed ripe.<br>
  Bopped him on the head, * botta bing * with a pipe!</p>
<p>He fell to the floor, with a groan and a thud.<br>
  I was kinda surprised, that I didn't see blood.<br>
  Instead he rolled over, looked me in the eye.<br>
  When I saw who I'd hit, I near started to cry.</p>
<p>I said &quot;hey 'yo Santa, I'm sorry all right?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Not for nuttin&quot; he said, &quot;but this just ain't my night!&quot;<br>
  &quot;I got lost in the Bronx, ran over some Nuns.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Had a near miss by Kennedy, Rudolf's got the runs...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm out all freakin night, I'm bustin my hump.&quot;<br>
  &quot;But I can't finish now, not with this lump!&quot;<br>
  &quot;So do me a favor, and be a real pal.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Take over for me...be Santa Sal.&quot;</p>
<p>I say 'Yo! I'm from Brooklyn, I ain't right for the part.<br>
  But he says that Santa Claus, comes from the heart.<br>
  He made me a offer, I could'nt refuse.<br>
  Stop at every house....except for the Jews!</p>
<p>I got into the suit, jumped onto the sleigh,<br>
  Wondering just why it was, reindeer smelled that way.<br>
  Took off on my mission, didn't want to be late.<br>
  While old Nick spent the night, hosin' my date.</p>
<p>That night I was Santa, bringing kids joy and bliss.<br>
  And if you don't believe that...hey, jingle dis!<br>
  Since then I been with him, each year in the cold.<br>
  Riding shotgun with Santa, 'cause he's fat, and he's old.</p>
<p>I'm his number one helper, I been deputized.<br>
  So on this Christmas Eve, don't you be surprised.<br>
  If you hear a voice say, real loud and abrupt.<br>
  &quot;Merry Christmas to all, thanks alot...shutup!&quot;</p>
