<p>by James Finn Garner</p>
<p class="words">'Twas the night before solstice and all through the co-op<br>
  Not a creature was messing the calm status quo up.</p>
<p class="words">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
  Dreaming of lentils and warm whole-grain breads.</p>
<p class="words">We'd welcomed the winter that day after school<br>
  By dancing and drumming and burning the Yule,</p>
<p class="words">A more meaningful gesture to honor the planet<br>
  Than buying more trinkets for Mom or Aunt Janet,</p>
<p class="words">Or choosing a tree just to murder and stump it<br>
  And dress it all up like a seasonal strumpet.</p>
<p class="words">My lifemate and I, having turned down the heat,<br>
  Slipped under the covers for a well-deserved sleep,</p>
<p class="words">When from out on the lawn there came such a roar<br>
  I fell from my futon and rolled to the floor.</p>
<p class="words">I crawled to the window and pulled back the latch,<br>
  And muttered, &quot;Aw, where is that Neighborhood Watch?&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> I saw there below through the murk of the night<br>
   A sleigh and eight reindeer of nonstandard height.</p>
<p class="words"> At the reins of that sleigh sat a mean-hearted knave<br>
   Who treated each deer like his personal slave.</p>
<p class="words"> I'd seen him before in some ads for car loans,<br>
   Plus fast food and soft drinks and cellular phones.</p>
<p class="words"> He must have cashed in from his mercantile chores,<br>
   Since self-satisfaction just oozed from his pores.</p>
<p class="words">He called each by name, as if he were right<br>
  To treat them like humans, entrenching his might:</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Now Donder, now Blitzen,&quot; and other such aliases,<br>
  Showing his true Eurocentrical biases.</p>
<p class="words">With a snap of his fingers away they all flew,<br>
   Like lumberjacks served up a plate of tofu.</p>
<p class="words"> Up to the rooftop they carried the sleigh<br>
   (The holes in the shingles are there to this day).</p>
<p class="words"> Out bounded the man, who went straight to the flue.<br>
   I knew in an instant just what I should do.</p>
<p class="words"> After donning my slippers, downstairs did I dash<br>
   to see this trespasser emerge from the ash.</p>
<p class="words"> His clothes were all covered with soot, but of course,<br>
   From our wood-fueled alternative energy source.</p>
<p class="words"> Through the grime I distinguished the make of his duds--<br>
   He was dressed all in fur, fairly dripping with blood.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;We're a cruelty-free house!&quot; I proclaimed with 
  such heat<br>
   He was startled and tripped on the logs at his feet.</p>
<p class="words"> He stood back up dazed, but with mirth in his eyes.<br>
   It was then that I noticed his unhealthy size.</p>
<p class="words"> He was almost as wide as when standing erect,<br>
   A lover of fatty fried foods, I suspect.</p>
<p class="words"> But that wasn't all to make sane persons choke:<br>
   In his teeth sat a pipe that was belching out smoke!</p>
<p class="words"> I could scarcely believe what invaded our house.<br>
   This carcinogenic and overweight louse</p>
<p class="words"> Was so red in the face from his energy spent,<br>
   I expected a heart attack right there and then.</p>
<p class="words"> Behind him he toted a red velvet bag<br>
   Full to exploding with sinister swag.</p>
<p class="words"> He asked, &quot;Where is your tree?&quot; with a face somewhat 
  long.<br>
   I said, &quot;Out in the yard, which is where it belongs.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;But where will I put all the presents I've brought?&quot;<br>
   I looked at him squarely and said, &quot;Take the lot</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;To some frivolous people who think that they need<br>
   to succumb to the sickness of commerce and greed,</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Whose only joy comes from the act of consuming,<br>
   Thus sending the stock of the retailers booming.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> He blinked and said, &quot;Ho, ho, ho! But you're kidding.&quot;<br>
   I gave him a stare that was stern and forbidding.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Surely children need something with which to have 
  fun?<br>
   It's like childhood's over before it's begun.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> He looked in my eyes for some sign of assent,<br>
   But I strengthened my will and refused to relent.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They have plenty of fun,&quot; I cut to the gist,<br>
   &quot;And your mindless distractions have never been missed.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They take CPR so that they can save lives,<br>
   And go door-to-door for the used clothing drives.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They recycle, renew, reuse -- and reveal<br>
   For saving the planet a laudable zeal.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;When they padlock themselves to a fence to protest<br>
   Against nuclear power, we think they're the best.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> He said, &quot;But they're children -- lo, when do they 
  play?&quot;<br>
   I countered, &quot;Is that why you've driven your sleigh,</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;To bring joy to the hearts of each child and tot?<br>
   All right, open your bag; let's see what you've got.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> He sheepishly did as I'd asked and behold!<br>
   A Malibu Barbie in a skirt made of gold.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;You think that my girls will like playing with this,<br>
   An icon of sexist, consumerist kitsch?</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;With it's unnatural figure and airheaded grin,<br>
   This trollop makes every girl yearn to be thin,</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;And take up fad diets and bingeing and purging<br>
   Instead of respecting her own body's urging</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;To welcome the shape that her body has found<br>
   And rejoice to be lanky, short, skinny, or round.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Deep in his satchel he searched for a toy,<br>
   Saying, &quot;This is a hit with most little boys.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> And what did he put in my trembling hand<br>
   But a gun from the BrainBlaster Power Command!</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;It's a 'hit,' to be sure,&quot; I sneered in his face,<br>
   &quot;And a plague to infect the whole human race!</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;How 'bout grenades or some working bazookas<br>
   To turn all of our kids into half-wit palookas?&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> I seized on his bag just to see for myself<br>
   The filth being spread by this odious elf.</p>
<p class="words"> An Easy-Bake Oven -- ah, goddess, what perfidy!<br>
   To hoodwink young girls into household captivity!</p>
<p class="words"> Plus an archer play set with shafts that fly out,<br>
   The very thing needed to put your eye out.</p>
<p class="words"> And toy metal tractors, steam shovels, and cranes<br>
   For tearing down woodlands and scarring the plains,</p>
<p class="words"> Plus &quot;games&quot; like Monopoly, Pay Day, Tycoon,<br>
   As if lessons in greed can't start up too soon.</p>
<p class="words"> And even more weapons from BrainBlastersCo.,<br>
   Like cannons and nunchucks and ray guns that glow.</p>
<p class="words"> That's all I could find in his red velvet sack --<br>
   Perverseness and mayhem to set us all back.</p>
<p class="words"> (But I did find one book that caused me to ponder --<br>
   Some fine bedtime tales by a fellow named Garner.)</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;We need none of this,&quot; I announced in a huff,<br>
   &quot;No 'business-as-usual' holiday stuff.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;We sow in our offspring more virtue than this.<br>
   Your 'toys' offer some things they never will miss.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> The big man's expression was a trifle bereaved<br>
   As he shouldered his pack and got ready to leave.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I pity the kids who grow up around here,<br>
   Who're never permitted to be of good cheer,</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Who aren't allowed leisure for leisure's own sake,<br>
   But must fret every minute -- it makes my heart break!&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Enough histrionics! Don't pity our kids<br>
   If they don't do as Macy's or Toys 'R' Us bids.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They live by their principles first and foremost<br>
   And know what's important,&quot; to him did I boast.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Pray, could I meet them&quot; &quot;Oh no, they're 
  not here.<br>
   They're up on the roof, liberating your deer!&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Then Santa Claus sputtered and pointed his finger<br>
   But, mad as he was, he had no time to linger.</p>
<p class="words"> He flew up the chimney like smoke from a fire,<br>
   And up on the roof I heard voices get higher.</p>
<p class="words"> I ran outside the co-op to see him react<br>
   To my children's responsible, kindhearted act.</p>
<p class="words"> He chased them away, and disheartened, dismayed,<br>
   He rehitched his reindeer (who'd docilely stayed).</p>
<p class="words"> I watched with delight as he scooted off then.<br>
   He'd be too embarrassed to come back again.</p>
<p class="words"> But with parting disdain, do you know what he said,<br>
   When this overweight huckster took off in his sled?</p>
<p class="words"> This reindeer enslaver, this exploiter of elves?<br>
   &quot;Happy Christmas to all, but get over yourselves!!&quot;</p>
