<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" -->If Cars were Operating Systems<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> What driving to the store would be like if cars 
were like operating systems: 
<p class="words"><strong>MS-DOS:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> You get in the car and try to remember where you put your 
    keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>WINDOWS:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">You get in the car and drive to the store very slowly, because 
    attached to the back of your car is a freight train.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>MACINTOSH SYSTEM 7:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">You get in the car to go to the store, and the car drives you 
    to church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>UNIX:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">You get in the car and type GREP STORE. After reaching speeds 
    of up to 200 miles per hour en route, you arrive at the barber shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>WINDOWS NT:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">You get in the car and write a letter that says, &quot;go to 
    the store&quot;. Then you get out of the car and mail the letter to your dashboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>TALIGENT/PINK:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">You walk to the store with Ricardo Montalban, who tells you 
    how wonderful it will be when he can fly you to the store in his Learjet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>OS/2:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">After fueling up with 6000 gallons of gas, you get in the car 
    and drive to the store with a motorcycle escort and a marching band in procession. 
    Half way there, the car blows up, killing everybody in town.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>S/36 SSP</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">(mainframe, obviously): You get in the car and drive to the 
    store. Half way there you run out of gas. While walking the rest of the way, 
    you are run over by kids on mopeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"><strong>OS/400:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">An attendant locks you in the car and then drives you to the 
    store, where you get to watch everybody else buy filet mignon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="right" class="words"> --Author Unknown</p>
<p class="words"><strong>Linux:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">(Added from another list.)</p>
  <p class="words"> You can't afford to buy a car, so you call Kar-Klub and order 
    their do-it-to-yourself kit. You're not worried when the big box arrives. 
    You tune to the local PBS and with &quot;This Old Car&quot; in the background, 
    you begin.</p>
  <p class="words"> You assemble the basics. The engine seems solid enough - except 
    for those eight extra bolt-holes. And yes, you only have three doors, but 
    Bob says that can be fixed with some plywood anyway. (Seems the door designer 
    drove a Pacer.) The car is a nice Cal-Trans orange, except for one door and 
    the hood. These are Mountain Dew green and purple. No problem -- you get out 
    the supplied Tempra paints.</p>
  <p class="words">The seat is missing, but you manage to scrounge one from the 
    old riding lawn-mower in the back. You turn the crank shaft - with a pair 
    of pliers -- and IT STARTS!</p>
  <p class="words">You put your foot on the gas wishing they hadn't used a bicycle 
    pedal -- the toe straps are really annoying, and head for the store. On your 
    way out the driveway, you floor it to avoid running into Jonny Cash.</p>
