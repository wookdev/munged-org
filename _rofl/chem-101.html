<p class="words">When I was in Cornell, Chemistry 101 was considered to be an 
  exceptionally difficult course. Weekly recitation classes followed the lectures, 
  to review homework assignments and help the floundering students. </p>
<p class="words">In our first recitation section, the teaching assistant started 
  handing out a pop quiz at the beginning of the class. As he was distributing 
  the quiz he explained, &quot;Just to make sure that everyone keeps up with the 
  homework, we are going to start each week with a little 'quizzy'. And it will 
  be a third of your grade.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">One of the female students at the front of the class who had 
  longer to examine the quiz than the rest of us, and who obviously did not recognize 
  any of questions as relating to things we should have known exclaimed loudly, 
  &quot;Well! If this is one of your little quizzies, I'd hate to see one of your 
  big Testies!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">While the laughter was dying down, a very red faced lady beat 
  a hasty exit for the door. We never saw her again.</p>
