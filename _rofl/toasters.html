<p class="words">If IBM made toasters...<br>
  They would want one big toaster where people bring bread to be submitted for 
  overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six toasters. 
</p>
<p class="words">If Xerox made toasters... <br>
  You could toast one-sided or double-sided. Successive slices would get lighter 
  and lighter. The toaster would jam your bread for you. </p>
<p class="words">If Radio Shack made toasters... <br>
  The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you could 
  buy all the parts to build your own toaster. </p>
<p class="words">If University of Waterloo made toasters... <br>
  They would immediately spin off a company called WatToast. </p>
<p class="words">If ParcPlace made toasters.. . <br>
  Their OO building block system would be called EGGO. </p>
<p class="words">If Oracle made toasters... <br>
  They'd claim their toaster was compatible with all brands and styles of bread, 
  but when you got it home you'd discover the Bagel Engine was still in development, 
  the Croissant Extension was three years away, and that indeed the whole appliance 
  was just blowing smoke. </p>
<p class="words">If Sun made toasters... <br>
  The toast would burn often, but you could get a really good cuppa Java. </p>
<p class="words">Does DEC still make toasters?... <br>
  They made good toasters in the '80s, didn't they? </p>
<p class="words">If Hewlett-Packard made toasters... <br>
  They would market the Reverse Polish Toaster, which takes in toast and gives 
  you regular bread. </p>
<p class="words">If Tandem made toasters... <br>
  You could make toast 24 hours a day, and if a piece got burned the toaster would 
  automatically toast you a new one. </p>
<p class="words">If Thinking Machines made toasters... <br>
  You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces of bread at the same time. </p>
<p class="words">If Cray made toasters... <br>
  They would cost $16 million but would be faster than any other single-slice 
  toaster in the world. </p>
<p class="words">If The Rand Corporation made toasters... <br>
  It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless black cube. Every morning 
  there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would 
  have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly 
  classified government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it. 
</p>
<p class="words">If the NSA made toasters... <br>
  Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in 
  case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security. </p>
<p class="words">If Sony made toasters... <br>
  The ToastMan, which would be barely larger than the single piece of bread it 
  is meant to toast, can be conveniently attached to your belt. </p>
<p class="words">If Timex made toasters... <br>
  They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking 
  and keep on toasting. </p>
<p class="words">If Fisher Price made toasters... <br>
  &quot;Baby's First Toaster&quot; would have a hand-crank that you turn to toast 
  the bread that pops up like a Jack-in-the-box. </p>
<p class="words">If the Franklin Mint made toasters... <br>
  Every month, you would receive another lovely hand-crafted piece of your authentic 
  hand-crafted Civil War pewter toaster. </p>
<p class="words">If CostCo made toasters... <br>
  They'd be really cheap, as long as you bought a six-pack of 'em. </p>
<p class="words">And, of course: </p>
<p class="words">If Microsoft made toasters... <br>
  Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You 
  wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it anyway. 
  Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds (hence requiring a reinforced steel countertop), 
  draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your 
  kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that lets you control how light 
  or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other 
  appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, 
  but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good bread only works with 
  their toasters. </p>
<p class="words">If Apple made toasters... <br>
  It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 years earlier. But, 
  they would only advertise it to people who already own one. </p>
