<p class="words">&quot;Where am I?&quot; asked Alice, as she peered at the large 
  7-lettered sign
  with the standard blue letters.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;You're in Digitaland,&quot; replied the security guard, 
  &quot;May I see your
  badge?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I don't have a badge.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Did you lose it?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No,&quot; answered Alice in a puzzled tone. &quot;How could 
  I lose something I
  never had?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;If it's not lost then you must show it to me.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I can't. I don't have one.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Then you'll have to have a temporary.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;A temporary what?&quot; asked Alice, more confused then 
  ever.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;A temporary Badge. What's your badge number?&quot; requested 
  the guard.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I don't have one&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Of course not, Ken Olsen has 1. Give me your badge number, 
  and your
  cost center&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I'm so confused. I can't do this. I've already said 3 times 
  why. Do
  I have to tell you 4?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Ahhh. 3XY, badge number 4. You must be very important to 
  have such a
  low badge number. I should have immediately recognized how low by your
  state of extreme confusion. Here's your temporary. Go right on in.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">Alice pasted the sticky paper to her dress and headed down the 
  hall.
  Not 10 feet ahead she saw a rather distressed looking rabbit coming
  toward her. He was dressed in a pair of torn, faded jeans, and a dirty
  tee shirt.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Alice asked.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I'm late! I'm late!&quot; exclaimed the rabbit as he peered 
  at the PERT
  chart dangling from his pocket protector.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Late for what?&quot; asked Alice.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;My date. I'm going to miss my date. I've got a deadline 
  to meet and
  I'm not going to make it.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Well, if it's already dead, it probably won't mind. In 
  fact it isn't
  likely to be going too far in such a state. I'm sure that however long
  you take will be just fine.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;You obviously don't understand. Everything takes longer 
  than it
  really does. It doesn't matter what you are doing, only that you meet
  your date, and that's always impossible.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Well if it's impossible, why would anyone expect you to 
  meet it?&quot;
  Almost at once regretting that she had asked. Was this was going to be
  as confusing as badges?
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;It's really very simple. In order to move forward, you 
  need a goal.
  Any goal will do. It just has to be impossible to do. To motivate the
  troops, you have to make goals very challenging. It's really only
  there to get a stake in the ground, you know. After that we march in
  step until we reach our objective. The date really doesn't mean
  anything. You simple have to understand that we are going to do the
  right thing.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;But the if the goal is impossible, and really doesn't mean 
  anything
  why are you trying to go there. Wouldn't it be simpler to first figure
  out what you are really going to do, then figure out how to get there?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;You obviously don't understand the process. And as I said 
  before I'm
  late so there is obviously only one thing to do.&quot;
  
  &quot;Hurry up and rush off?&quot; Alice asked, hoping it would sound more like
  a suggestion than a question.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No. No. No. A meeting. Let me find the Mad Manager and 
  a number of
  involved, interested, or warm bodies.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;That will obviously take a lot of time. I don't think you 
  have any to
  waste.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No it won't. All we have to do is find a conference room. 
  There are
  lots of them right over here.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;But,&quot; started Alice, &quot;those rooms are all full 
  of people. Don't we
  need an empty conference room?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Silly thought. If we want to find the Mad Manager and some 
  meeting
  attendees, why would we look in an empty conference room? Anyway, it's
  impossible to ever find an empty conference room.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">The rabbit took Alice by the hand, and promptly lead her into 
  the
  largest, fullest conference room. Alice immediately noticed that the
  wastebasket was quite full of foam cups, and overhead projector bulbs.
  These people had obviously been here for a long time.
</p>
<p class="words">At the head of the table sat a man with a rather funny suit wearing 
  a
  large hat.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Why&quot; whispered Alice to the rabbit, &quot;is that 
  man wearing that funny
  hat? Who is he?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I'm the Mad Manager,&quot; answered the man at the end 
  of the table,
  obviously overhearing the question, &quot; And I'll be happy to tell you
  why I'm wearing this Hat, but that topic is not on the agenda.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Why don't we change the agenda?&quot; asked a person in 
  the corner.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Is that a topic for another meeting?&quot; replied the 
  manager.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Is what a topic for another meeting?&quot; voiced a third. 
  &quot;The reason
  for the hat, or why we don't change the agenda?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Why don't we take this off line?&quot; queried another.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Does everyone agree that these are all topics we should 
  address?&quot;
  asked the mad manager.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Possibly so. &quot; injected the person in the corner. 
  &quot;Could it be that
  we have a hidden agenda?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Oh no!&quot; the Mad Manager began, the dismay obvious 
  on his face,
  &quot;someone has hidden the agenda again! Let me put on my process hat and
  we'll see if we can work this issue.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">With that, he removed his rather amusing top hat, and place a 
  big green
  fedora on his head.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Now, with my process hat on, I'd like to address the issue 
  of the
  hidden agenda. Since we can't have a productive meeting without an
  agenda, it is up to all of us to find it.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;But, &quot; a voice from the corner piped in, &quot;who 
  is going to drive this
  issue?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Do we have an action item here?&quot; asked another attendee.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Does anyone here want to work this?&quot; asked the mad 
  manager.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Who originally brought this up?&quot; asked another.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I believe that the woman who came in with the rabbit proposed 
  this.
  Shouldn't she own it?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Well&quot; the Manager stated, pointing to Alice. &quot;I'd 
  say that this is
  your issue.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;What issue. I don't have any issues. &quot; retorted Alice, 
  nervously
  fingering her temporary badge. &quot;I only posed a simple question.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I'm not sure we can accept that,&quot; the manager declared. 
  &quot;We need a
  date.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;But, &quot; Alice began, remembering what the rabbit told 
  her about dates,
  &quot;a date is impossible.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">From the back of the room another voice asked, &quot;How about 
  a date for a
  date?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;The least we can ask it that you give us a date when you 
  will be able
  to give us the date for the date.&quot; stated the person in the corner.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I'm not sure I can do that,&quot; Alice opened, &quot;since 
  I don't know what
  I'm supposed to give you a date for. I'm having a problem trying to
  figure out what you want me to do.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;We don't have any problems here, only opportunities!&quot; 
  Piped a chorus
  of voices.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;It's really quite obvious,&quot; the mad manager declared 
  as he reached
  behind him for a striped blue and gray beret, &quot;let me put on my Digital
  hat for a moment,&quot; he continued doffing the fedora and flipping on his
  latest selection, &quot;You must do the right thing.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Yes. Yes.&quot; chimed the chorus of attendees, &quot;Do 
  the right thing. </p>
<p class="words">&quot;Now, who is keeping the minutes?&quot; the manager asked 
  as he pitched the
  beret and placed the fedora back on his head. &quot;We need to record this
  action item so we can come back to it later.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;We obviously can't deal with this issue until we can determine 
  whose
  meeting this is?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Should we schedule some time to cover that topic?&quot; 
  asked one of the
  attendees.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Whose going to drive this?&quot; asked another.
</p>
<p class="words">Just at the Mad Manager was pulling out a rather worn pith helmet, 
  a
  voice in the back suggested &quot;Let's take a break and work some of this
  1x1 off line&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">Being closest to the door Alice was the first to leave. She quickly
  dashed down the hall, and ran up the first flight of stairs she
  encountered, relieved to be free of the madness.
</p>
<p class="words">When she opened the door the scene that confronted her made her 
  wonder
  if returning to the meeting wasn't a bad idea. Seated around a large
  oval table were what appeared to be playing cards, each dressed in a
  gray or navy blue three piece suit. Around each neck was a rather
  oddly shaped handle (or were they nooses?) made of silk, or polyester.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Off with her head!&quot; screamed the queen of hearts who 
  was sitting at
  the head of the table. Alice noticed that her tie was silk, and each
  card seated near her was dressed in a suit and noose combination
  similar to the queen's.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Why would you want to remove my head?&quot; Alice asked. 
  By now she was
  feeling beyond confused.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;It's not a modern, iconic, user friendly, menu driven, 
  color, PC
  compatible user interface,&quot; replied the queen, in a tone that would
  need to come up two notches to be vaguely considered condescending.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;It happens to suit me just fine,&quot; retorted Alice.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;What are you an engineer or something?&quot; asked the 
  7 of spades.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No, I'm Alice. Who are you?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Marketing.&quot; they replied in perfect fifty-two part 
  harmony.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;And what is that?&quot; asked Alice.
</p>
<p class="words">There was a brief interlude of silence as each of the cards fidgeted 
  with their ties, checked their watches and scribbled notes on the pads of paper 
  contained in a handsome genuine imitation leather folder embossed with the company 
  logo. Then one by one, as dominoes would do, they turned to the person on the 
  left until they all stared at the queen of hearts.</p>
<p class="words">The queen cleared her throat, adjusted her tie a second time 
  and stared directly at Alice. &quot;We provide the strategic thinking necessary 
  to grow the business.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Alice, &quot;you figure out what products 
  to build!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Heavens, no!&quot; exclaimed the Queen, &quot;That's too 
  tactical. We feel it's our job to develop the vision for the long term.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;You develop things,&quot; began Alice, &quot;so you build 
  the products?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">In unison each member of the table made a face reminiscent of 
  the look a small child gets upon tasting spoiled dead roaches for the first 
  time.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Uggggh, that's even more tactical,&quot; jeered the chorus.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No! No!&quot; shouted the Queen. &quot;You still do not 
  understand. We take the pulse of the key market leaders demand curve.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I see now.&quot; said Alice, &quot;You sell the products.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">By now the chorus of cards chanting &quot;Tac-ti-cal! Tactical!&quot; 
  was becoming too much.</p>
<p class="words">The queen was furious and repeated her original greeting. &quot;Off 
  with her head! Off With her head&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;WAIT!&quot; demanded Alice. &quot;I believe I understand. 
  You are all responsible for driving the solution opportunities for the key client 
  supply perceptions through strategic vision management!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Alice wondered if she should add something about the claws catching, 
  and frumious bandersnatches and thought that she'd best leave it at that before 
  she became ill.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Yes,&quot; screamed the cards, &quot;That's exactly right!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;And how, might I ask, do you accomplish these lofty and 
  important goals?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;By calling a BOD,&quot; the queen responded.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;And what, pray tell, might that be?&quot; inquired Alice 
  as she looked for the quickest escape route, hoping that this jabber would keep 
  her head attached long enough to get out.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;A Board of Directors,&quot; began the queen, just as Alice 
  noticed the door to the left of the table. &quot;It's a type of high level meeting.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;A meeting????!!!!&quot; exclaimed Alice. &quot;Not another 
  meeting!&quot; With that she bolted for the door, no longer fearing for her 
  head. Her only hope was that she make it through before the agenda hit the overhead. 
  In a dead run, she passed through the door just as the projector lamp flicked 
  on. The sound of the fan was the last sound to fade as the door closed.</p>
<p class="words">Breathlessly she looked up to see a large open area. Directly 
  in front of her was an enclosed area lined on one side with triple chrome table. 
  A stack of plastic trays was at the foyer.</p>
<p class="words">As she wandered through an assortment of sandwiches, prepared 
  foods, soft drinks and salad began their daily spiel. &quot;Eat Me! Drink Me! 
  Eat Me!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Oh no,&quot; answered Alice, &quot;I may know nothing about 
  dates, and problems and meetings and agendas, and marketing and badges, but 
  I do know food. I'm not gonna touch any of you. After the morning I've had I 
  deserve a nice cheese steak (no lettuce)!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">With that, Alice opened the nearest exit door and left. A resounding 
  high pitched whine sang it's midday good-byes as Alice returned to the real 
  world. </p>
