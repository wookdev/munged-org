  <p class="words">From somone who learned them the hard way<br>
    (Well, maybe) </p>
</center>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hairdressers:</font></h4>
<p class="words">Always assume that your barbers and hairdressers are from another 
  galaxy where &quot;Just give me a trim&quot; is actually Moronian for &quot;What 
  the hell, just chop it all off.&quot; If you have a picture of yourself with 
  a halfway decent haircut, bring it in and point at it mutely. They'll understand. 
  Just make sure there aren't any pets in the picture with you, or they might 
  get confused; God only knows what you'll wind up looking like then.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dealing with Roommates:</font></h4>
<p class="words">Undesirable roommates can be disposed of by surreptitiously stapling 
  or gluing bills of large denominations to the backs of their jackets. This works 
  best if you live in one of the seedier parts of town. It costs much less than 
  a hit man, and it's perfectly legal. I think.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Selecting a Place to Live:</font></h4>
<p class="words">Big basements are key. People you barely know will ask you to
  store all sorts of stuff for them. *Lots* of stuff. Just tell them,
  &quot;OK,&quot; take their junk, and sell it the next day; they'll forget about
  it and never ask for it again anyhow. If they do, simply inform them
  that their sofas have been &quot;liberated&quot; by the Berserkers Advocating
  Rights for Furniture. They'll understand, and they won't bother you
  any longer. Especially if you mention that you are a member of the
  aforementioned organization. Make sure that you foam at the mouth
  when you say this. Be rabid, *with conviction*.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bathroom Etiquette/Survivial:</font></h4>
<p class="words"> If you live in an apartment or house and are responsible for
  cleaning the bathroom yourself (translation: the bathroom is cleaned
  bicentenially), use orange shampoo. This way, you can rationalize
  that the orange slimy stuff growing on your shower curtains is
  actually merely a buildup of shampoo residue. Important note: if you
  have a roommate in the biological sciences, under NO curcumstances
  allow him to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish. And if he does, for
  heaven's sake, don't snort it, especially if there are sharp objects
  lying around that you could hurt yourself with later. (I still have
  the scars.)</p>
<p class="words"> If the water pressure is low, when you use the bathroom, do 
  your
  business, flush immediately, *then* wipe yourself up and flush again.
  No sense in having to duck flying pieces of crap while you're plunging
  the toilet.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yard Maintenance:</font></h4>
<p class="words"> When birds start perching on the lawn, it's time to mow it.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leftovers:</font></h4>
<p class="words"> Make sure to eat leftovers before the predator/prey relationship
  between you and your food reverses itself through a process of
  accelerated evolution. If you're not sure just how far this process
  has gone so far, keep a heavy, blunt object handy while cleaning out
  the fridge.</p>
<p class="words">Even after leftovers have gotten to this stage, they can still 
  be
  put to good use: if you dump them in the trash (after clubbing them
  a couple of times, of course) just before going on a two- or three-
  day trip, the resulting stench will ensure that one of your roommates
  will take out the garbage for you while you're gone.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bedtime Attire:</font></h4>
<p class="words">If you're a sleepwalker, don't go to bed in the buff.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Doing Push-ups&quot;:</font></h4>
<p class="words">In the making of the beast with two backs, avoid the resonant 
  frequency of your living complex, or you'll hear no end of it from your neighbors. 
  If you do hit that frequency, though, and you know you've been caught, stay 
  with it for a little while. If you only have the place rocking for a few seconds, 
  then you'll <strong>really</strong> hear no end of it.</p>
