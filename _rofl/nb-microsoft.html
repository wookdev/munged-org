<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> The Night Before Christmas (Microsoft 
  Version)<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p>'Twas the night before Christmas,<br>
  when all through the house<br>
  Not a creature was stirring,<br>
  except Papa's mouse.<br>
  The computer was humming,<br>
  the icons were hopping,<br>
  As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.</p>
<p>The stockings were hung by the modem with care<br>
  In hope that St. Nicolas would bring new software.<br>
  The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
  While visions of computer games danced in their heads.</p>
<p> Dark Forces for Billy, and Doom II for Dan,<br>
  And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.<br>
  The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,<br>
  To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com</p>
<p> Which has now been re-routed to Washington State<br>
  Because Santa's workshop has been bought by Bill Gates.<br>
  All the elves and reindeer have had to skedaddle<br>
  To flashy new quarters in suburban Seattle.</p>
<p> After centuries of a life that was simple and spare,<br>
  St. Nicolas is suddenly a new billionaire,<br>
  With a shiny red Porsche in the place of his sleigh,<br>
  And a house on Lake Washington that's just down the way</p>
<p> From where Bill has his mansion.<br>
  The old fellow preens<br>
  In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.<br>
  The elves have stock options and desks with a view,<br>
  Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.</p>
<p> No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums<br>
  Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS<br>
  With the Microsoft label.</p>
<p> So spin up your drive,<br>
  From now on Christmas runs only on Windows 95.</p>
<p> More rapid than eagles the competitors came,<br>
  And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.<br>
  &quot;Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,<br>
  Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! all of you are through,</p>
<p> It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,<br>
  It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist -<br>
  Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,<br>
  And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.</p>
<p> Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,<br>
  And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.<br>
  To the top of the NASDAQ!<br>
  To the top of the Dow!<br>
  Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!&quot;</p>
<p> And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,<br>
  Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br>
  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
  The whirr and the hum of our satellite platter,</p>
<p> As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,<br>
  The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.<br>
  As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,<br>
  My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.</p>
<p> And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates<br>
  Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.<br>
  And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,<br>
  Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT. </p>
