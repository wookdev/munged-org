<p class="words"> One basic truth: Men and women are different.
</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Now, this may seem a little simplistic, but the fact is, for a period of about 
  
  six months in 1973, it was very fashionable to believe that we were all persons
  first, and members of our gender second.</p>
<p class="words">
  This, of course, was so much hooey.</p>
<p class="words">
  We are different -- in our habits, and in the way we react to environmental 
  
  stimuli and the way we spend our leisure time; and we are especially different
  when it comes to our attitudes regarding relationships.
  
</p>
<p class="words"> My personal observations have uncovered many significant differences 
  between 
  men and women.
  
</p>
<p class="words"> RELATIONSHIPS
</p>
<p class="words"> 
  First of all, a man does not call a relationship. He refers to it as a 
  romance, or a period of dating, of going out, or, in some unfortunate 
  circumstances, &quot;that time when me and Suzie was doing it on a semi-regular 
  
  basis.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> 
  When a relationship ends, a woman will cry, and pour her heart out to her 
  girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled &quot;All Men are Morons.&quot; 
  Then she 
  will get on with her life.</p>
<p class="words"> 
  A man has a little more trouble letting go. For six months, his ex may not 
  hear from him, but then, at three on Saturday night/Sunday morning, he will 
  call
  and say, &quot;I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never 
  
  forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a total bitch. But I want to let you 
  
  know there's always a chance for us.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> 
  This is known as the &quot;I Hate You/I Love You&quot; drunken phone call. Ninety-nine 
  
  percent of all men past the age of 21 have made this call at least once. Some
  men make a career of these calls. There are community colleges that offer 
  extension courses to help men get over this need; alas, these classes rarely 
  
  prove effective.</p>
<p class="words"> 
  SEX</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women prefer 30 to 45 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 45 seconds of 
  foreplay, less if at all possible. For the man, driving back to her place is 
  
  considered a part of foreplay.</p>
<p class="words"> 
  MATURITY</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women mature at a much faster rate than men. Most 17 year old females can 
  function as adults. Most 17 year old males are still trading baseball cards 
  
  and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school 
  romances rarely work.
</p>
<p class="words">
  HATS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.
</p>
<p class="words">
  GROCERIES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  A woman knows how to shop for groceries. She makes a list of the things she 
  
  needs, and then goes to the store and buys these things. A man does not shop 
  
  on a frequent basis. He waits until the only items left in his refrigerator 
  
  are an opened can of Schlitz and a half a lime. Then he goes grocery shopping.
  A man buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout
  counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett's car on the Beverly
  Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10 items or 
  
  less lane.
</p>
<p class="words">
  MAGAZINES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Women's magazines also
  feature pictures of naked ladies. This is because the female body is a 
  beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not 
  be
  seen by the light of day.
</p>
<p class="words">
  Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. Naked men elicit 
  laughter from women.
</p>
<p class="words">
  HANDWRITING
</p>
<p class="words">
  To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just 
  chickenscratch. Women use scented, colored stationary, and they dot their 
  &quot;i's&quot; with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops 
  in their
  &quot;p's&quot; and &quot;g's.&quot; It is a royal pain to read a note from 
  a woman. Even when 
  she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.
</p>
<p class="words">
  COMEDY
</p>
<p class="words">
  Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching television, 
  
  and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on. Immediately, the men will get 
  
  very excited; they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions
  of Curly, man's favorite stooge. The women will roll their eyes and groan and 
  
  wait it out.
</p>
<p class="words">
  BATHROOMS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  A man has 6 items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, 
  a
  razor, a bar of Dial soap and a towel from a Holiday Inn. The average number 
  of
  items in a typical American women's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able 
  
  to identify most of these items.
</p>
<p class="words">
  Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women's Restrooms always
  have long lines.
</p>
<p class="words">
  GOING OUT</p>
<p class="words"> 
  When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When 
  a
  woman says she is ready to go out, it means she will be ready, as soon as she 
  
  finds her other earring, makes one phone call and finishes putting on her 
  makeup.
</p>
<p class="words">
  CATS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men 
  
  kick cats.
  
</p>
<p class="words">SHOES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip 
  
  in Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks.
  When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later
  she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear 
  
  one pair of shoes for the entire day.
</p>
<p class="words">
  LEG WARMERS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she's walking the dog or doing the 
  dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants.
  A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the &quot;Gimme the 
  Ball&quot; 
  number in A Chorus Line.
  
</p>
<p class="words">MIRRORS
</p>
<p class="words">
  Men are vain; they will check themselves out in the mirror. Women are 
  ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface, 
  mirrors,
  spoons, store window, toasters, Joe Garagiola's head.
  
</p>
<p class="words">MENOPAUSE</p>
<p class="words"> 
  When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated 
  emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree of 
  these changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a 
  uniform reaction --- he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather 
  
  driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.
  
</p>
<p class="words">THE TELEPHONE</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send
  short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two 
  weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will 
  
  talk for three hours.
  
</p>
<p class="words">OFFSPRING</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist 
  
  appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods
  and hopes and dreams. Every year, men have to be reminded of his children's 
  
  birthdays.
  
</p>
<p class="words">LOW BLOWS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Let's say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on television. One of
  the figures is felled by a low blow. The woman says, &quot;Oh gee, that must 
  hurt.&quot;
  The man doubles over and actually feels the pain.
</p>
<p class="words">
  DIRECTIONS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, 
  
  she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to 
  
  be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will 
  
  drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, &quot;Looks love 
  I've
  found a new way to get there.&quot; and, &quot;I know I'm in the general neighborhood. 
  
  I recognize that White Hen store.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">
  ADMITTING MISTAKES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women will sometimes admit making a mistake. The last man who admitted he was
  wrong was General George Custer.
</p>
<p class="words">
  RICHARD GERE</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate 
  Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health
  club and dates only married women.
</p>
<p class="words">
  DRESSING UP
  
</p>
<p class="words">A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty 
  the garbage, 
  answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for:
  weddings, funerals.
  
</p>
<p class="words">NICKNAMES
</p>
<p class="words">
  With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like 
  &quot;Ultimate Pecs&quot; and &quot;Big Turk,&quot; women eschew the use of 
  nicknames. If Gloria,
  Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each 
  other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dirk, Clint, and 
  
  Jack go out for a brewski, they will affectionately refer to one another as
  Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.
  
</p>
<p class="words">TOYS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12,
  they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they
  get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.
  Examples of men's toys: little miniature TV's. Car phones. Complicated 
  juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails 
  
  on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 
  
  6 &quot;D&quot; batteries to operate.
</p>
<p class="words"> PLANTS</p>
<p class="words"> A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. 
  The man waters
  the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full 
  of
  dead plants. No one knows why this happens.
  
</p>
<p class="words">MOUSTACHES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Some men look good with mustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt 
  Reynolds. There are no women who look good with mustaches.
  
</p>
<p class="words">DAVID LETTERMAN</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth. Women
  think he is a mean, semidorky guy who always has a bad haircut.
  
</p>
<p class="words">CAMERAS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men take photography very seriously. They'll shell out $4000 for state of the
  art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women 
  purchase Kodak Instamatics. Of course women always end up taking better 
  pictures.
  
</p>
<p class="words">LOCKER ROOMS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women, 
  
  They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they 
  
  think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one 
  
  thing in the locker room -- sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are
  extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.
</p>
<p class="words">
  LAUNDRY</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women do the laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of 
  
  clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were really hip about 
  eight years ago, before he will do the laundry. When he is finally out of 
  clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatsuit inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his
  mountain of dirty clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet
  beautiful women at the Laundromat, but this is only a myth perpetuated by old 
  
  reruns of Love American Style.
</p>
<p class="words">
  POLITICS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such 
  
  as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy's is 
  growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for
  them and cry on election night.
</p>
<p class="words">
  WEDDINGS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  When reminiscing about weddings women talk about &quot;the ceremony.&quot; Men 
  talk 
  about &quot;the bachelor party.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words">
  CHEERLEADERS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all American. Male cheerleaders
  are scary.
</p>
<p class="words">
  SOCKS</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Men are sensible about socks. They wear argyle socks or standard white 
  sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks with pictures of clouds on them.
  Socks that are cut way below their ankles. socks that have little fuzzy balls
  on the back.
</p>
<p class="words">
  GARAGES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use 
  garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, and they watch 
  
  TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.
</p>
<p class="words">
  MOVIES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  For women their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh 
  
  for the first time in Gone With the Wind. For men it's when Jimmy Cagney shoves
  grapefruit in may Clark's face in Public Enemy.
</p>
<p class="words">
  NUDITY IN MOVIES</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is 
  because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The 
  
  only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is 
  
  another reason why men hate him.
</p>
<p class="words">
  JEWELRY</p>
<p class="words"> 
  Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one 
  
  ring and that's it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer 
  
  named Vic.
</p>
<p class="words">
  THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE OF ALL</p>
<p class="words"> Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to 
  wear colored 
  underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides
  solid white.</p>
