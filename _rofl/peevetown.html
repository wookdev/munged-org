<p class="words"> At the end of a long hard day, the man did return to that place 
  where he lived. Upon his arrival, he felt the need to use the Euphemism, and 
  so he did go into the bathroom.</p>
<p class="words">In the white porcelain bathtub the man saw a dark critter with 
  six or more legs, which had not been there when he bathed last, at the beginning 
  of this long hard day.</p>
<p class="words">The man watched the critter for a time, and wondered how it came 
  to be there. It was trapped in the bathtub: it climbed up the side of the tub, 
  until it reached that point where its weight overcame its friction against the 
  side of the tub, did slide back down to the bottom, and set out again to climb 
  up the side of the tub.</p>
<p class="words">The man, tiring of this after several repetitions, tore a strip 
  from the bogroll he kept near to the Euphemism, and did place this strip on 
  the side of the tub so that the critter could climb to the top upon it.</p>
<p class="words">The critter spied the strip, and instead of climbing upon it, 
  did run to the other side of the tub where it resumed its climbing of the wall 
  of the tub and sliding down.</p>
<p class="words">Seeing this, the man was disappointed. He then gathered up the 
  bogroll strip into a great wad, with which he did smite the critter beyond the 
  limits of its exoskeleton. The man did then place wad and critter in the bowl 
  of the Euphemism, not as an offering but as refuse, whereupon he relieved himself.</p>
<p class="words">Therefore, if you do go into a place, see that you do not announce 
  yourself straightaway, but instead look, and listen, and learn the ways of the 
  people in that place, until you are ready to announce yourself in a way that 
  will not seem out of place or unwelcome to those people, lest they smite you.</p>
<p class="words">And if it should come to pass that you do announce yourself, 
  and find that you are or were not ready, or that you misjudged, be mindful of 
  those who offer commentary and advice, and learn from them, even if such advice 
  does seem rudely given. Do not turn from them and persist in your course, lest 
  they discard you as refuse, and relieve themselves upon you.</p>
