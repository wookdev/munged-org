<p class="words"> ( to the tune of, &quot;American Pie&quot; )</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> A long, long time ago,<br>
  I can still remember when I dialed up their help desk lines.<br>
  And I knew if I had the chance, they could make my modem dance with chats and 
  GIFs and silly<br>
  pick-up lines.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> But, Help Desk phone calls made me shiver with every busy they'd 
  deliver.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Bad news on the front page,<br>
  A 19-hour outrage.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> I can't remember if I cried when I realized that Steve Case 
  had lied.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> But something touched me deep inside,<br>
  The day, the ser-vice died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Did you write the book of TOS,<br>
  Will you send your password to PWD-BOSS if an IM tells you so.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And will you believe the Motley Fool when he tells you that 
  the service rules,<br>
  And, can you teach me how to web real slow?</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Well, I know you sold the service short,<br>
  'Cause I saw your quarterly report.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Steve Case sold off his stock,<br>
  It fell just like a rock.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> It was a crazy, costly high-tech play, as they slashed away 
  at what subscribers pay,<br>
  And half their users went away, the day the service died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Well for two days we've been on our own<br>
  And dial-ins click on a rolling phone<br>
  But that's not how it used to be,<br>
  When the mogul came to Virginia court, With an OS icon and a browser port,<br>
  And a desktop that looked like Apple III.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And while Jim Clark was looking down,<br>
  The mogul stole his thorny crown,<br>
  The browser war was turned,<br>
  Mozilla,... was spurned.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And while Steve left users out to bond,<br>
  With hosts unable to respond,<br>
  6 million newbies all were conned,<br>
  The day the service died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Da Chronic ducked their software guards,<br>
  And stole a million credit cards, to use accounts he'd gotten free.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And so Steve Case went to the FBI,<br>
  and he told Boardwatch* a little lie,<br>
  That hackers wanted child pornography *<br>
  But while Steve Case was looking down,<br>
  The hackers pulled his e-mail down,<br>
  They put it on the net,<br>
  He can't be trusted, yet!</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And while user cynicism climbs,<br>
  At sign-on ads and welcome rhymes, they scan their e-mail for, &quot;Good Times,&quot;<br>
  The day the ser-vice died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Helter-skelter billing needs a melter,<br>
  The lawyers filed a class-action shelter,<br>
  Eight million in lawyer's fees.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> But it looks like some attorney jibe,<br>
  an hour if they resubscribe,<br>
  To a service marketed for free.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Well, I know you're raking in the bucks,<br>
  'Cause I'm reading alt.aol-sucks.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> &quot;Until we bless the suit,<br>
  The settlement is moot.&quot;</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> &quot;If AOL treats you like the Borg,<br>
  Then visit aolsucks.org,<br>
  Before some router pulls the cord,...&quot;<br>
  The day the ser-vice died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Bill Razzouk, the head-to-be,<br>
  sold off his home in Tennessee,<br>
  And headed for a 4-month end.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> Was he sad or just incensed when Case offered him his thirty 
  cents.<br>
  Billing is the devil's only friend.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> But as I read him on the page,<br>
  My hands were clenched in fists of rage,<br>
  No, &quot;Welcome&quot; born in hell, could ring that chatroom bell.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And as chat freaks cried into the night, CompuServe read their 
  last rites.<br>
  I saw Earthlink laughing with delight, The day the ser-vice died.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
  Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
  And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
  Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
  This'll be the day that they die.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> I met a girl in Lobby 9,<br>
  And I asked her if she'd stay online,<br>
  But she just frowned and looked away,</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And I went back to the Member Lounge, To see what loyalty I 
  could scrounge.<br>
  But Room Host said the members went away,...</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And on the net the modems screamed,<br>
  At faster bits and data streams.</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And not a tear was spoken,<br>
  The hourly fees were broken,</p>
<p align="center" class="words"> And the three men that I hated most: Ted, and Steve, and Razzouk's 
  ghost,<br>
  They couldn't dial up the host,<br>
  The day the ser-vice died.</p>
