<p><strong>REMAINING U.S. CEOs MAKE A BREAK FOR IT </strong></p>
<p class="words">Band of Roving Chief Executives Spotted Miles from Mexican Border 
</p>
<p class="words">San Antonio, Texas(Reuters) - Unwilling to wait for their eventual 
  indictments, the 10,000 remaining CEOs of public U.S. companies made a break 
  for it yesterday, heading for the Mexican border, plundering towns and villages 
  along the way, and writing the entire rampage off as a marketing expense. </p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They came into my home, made me pay for my own TV, then 
  double-booked the revenues,&quot; said Rachel Sanchez of Las Cruces, just north 
  of El Paso. </p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Right in front of my daughters.&quot; Calling themselves 
  the CEOnistas, the chief executives were first spotted last night along the 
  Rio Grande River near Quemado, where they bought each of the town's 320 residents 
  by borrowing against pension fund gains. By late this morning, the CEOnistas 
  had arbitrarily inflated Quemado's population to 960, and declared a 200 percent 
  profit for the fiscal second quarter. </p>
<p class="words">This morning, the outlaws bought the city of Waco, transferred 
  its underperforming areas to a private partnership, and sent a bill to California 
  for $4.5 billion. </p>
<p class="words">Law enforcement officials and disgruntled shareholders riding 
  posse were noticeably frustrated. </p>
<p class="words"> &quot;First of all, they're very hard to find because they always 
  stand behind their numbers, and the numbers keep shifting,&quot; said posse 
  spokesman Dean Lewitt. &quot;And every time we yell 'Stop in the name of the 
  shareholders!', they refer us to investor relations. I've been on the phone 
  all damn morning.&quot; </p>
<p class="words"> &quot;YOU'LL NEVER AUDIT ME ALIVE!&quot; they scream. The pursuers 
  said they have had some success, however, by preying on a common executive weakness. 
  &quot;Last night we caught about 24 of them by disguising one of our female 
  officers as a CNBC anchor,&quot; said U.S. Border Patrol spokesperson Janet 
  Lewis. &quot;It was like moths to a flame.&quot; </p>
<p class="words">Also, teams of agents have been using high-powered listening 
  devices to scan the plains for telltale sounds of the CEOnistas. &quot;Most 
  of the time we just hear leaves rustling or cattle flicking their tails,&quot; 
  said Lewis, &quot;but occasionally we'll pick up someone saying, 'I was totally 
  out of the loop on that.&quot; </p>
<p class="words">Among former and current CEOs apprehended with this method were 
  Computer Associates' Sanjay Kumar, Adelphia's John Rigas, Enron's Ken Lay, Joseph 
  Nacchio of Qwest, Joseph Berardino of Arthur Andersen, and -=every=- Global 
  Crossing CEO since 1997. ImClone Systems' Sam Waksal and Dennis Kozlowski of 
  Tyco were not allowed to join the CEOnistas as they have already been indicted. 
</p>
<p class="words">So far, about 50 chief executives have been captured, including 
  Martha Stewart, who was detained south of El Paso where she had cut through 
  a barbed-wire fence at the Zaragosa border crossing off Highway 375. &quot;She 
  would have gotten away, but she was stopping motorists to ask for marzipan and 
  food coloring so she could make edible snowman place settings, using the cut 
  pieces of wire for the arms,&quot; said Border Patrol officer Jenette Cushing. 
  &quot;We put her in cell No. 7, because the morning sun really adds texture 
  to the stucco walls.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> While some stragglers are believed to have successfully crossed 
  into Mexico, Cushing said the bulk of the CEOnistas have holed themselves up 
  at the Alamo. &quot;No, not the fort, the car rental place at the airport,&quot; 
  she said. &quot;They're rotating all the tires on the minivans and accounting 
  for each change as a sale.&quot;</p>
