<p>*ring* *ring* </p>
<p>&quot;Hello! Local ISP, how can I help you?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, I was sorta hoping someone could walk me through taking a leak&quot; 
</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... well, do you have to go now?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I do&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... well, are you on male or female equipment?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;MALE-CLONE...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, the first thing we want to do is find your fly..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;My what?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Your fly... it opens your pants. It should be in the front of you. Look 
  down&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see shoes&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No, sir... look sorta in the front of you... like just below your stomach. 
  You should see some metal on your pants. That's your fly..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The round thing?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, that's your button... let's open that, too, while we're down there. 
  The fly looks like a lot of little metal things sideways&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay.. got it. &lt;pause&gt; Okay, it's open..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, sir... can you grab your willy?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do you see your willy?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... what do you see?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I see white... just white and some lines..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do you have underwear installed?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sir, if you can't see your willy, and you see only white... I think that 
  you may have underwear installed. We are going to have to uninstall your underwear 
  to take a leak....&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, my friend was the last one to use my fly... he might have installed 
  underwear...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, sir... well grab the white part and pull down... keep pulling until 
  you see your willy..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;It's stuck... it won't go down...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The white part? Or your willy?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;My willy...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;DON'T pull down on your willy, sir... just the underwear... we only want 
  to get to the point where we can see it....&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh... okay, we're there....&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... now look around the room... do you see anything made of porcelain?&quot; 
</p>
<p>&quot;I see a little penguin on a shelf ...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, sir...you're in the living room.... go to the bathroom. We can't 
  take a leak until we are in the bathroom. The bathroom will have a lot of tile, 
  maybe some carpeting... yours might have mirrors or some soap in it. Some people 
  have showers in their bathrooms...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'm downstairs... I think the bathroom is upstairs...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, well... let's go upstairs...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I can't walk...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, sir... temporarily reinstall your underwear... then go upstairs.. 
  then uninstall your underwear again...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That was the white part, right?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir... that's correct...&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;pause&gt;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I'm upstairs...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... now do you see any porcelain bowl-type things?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, there's two...&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;How tall are you sir?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;5'4&quot; ..&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... go to the one where it's lower than your willy....&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay....I'm there&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay... now make sure that you are pointing toward the porcelain bowl.. 
  now just go.... &quot; </p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, when it pops up... just hit 'okay'.....&quot; </p>
