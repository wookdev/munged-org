<p class="words">A guy dies and wakes up to find he is in hell. He's really depressed 
  as he stands in the processing line waiting to talk to an admittance counselor. 
  He thinks to himself &quot;I know I lead a wild life but I wasn't that bad. 
  I never thought it would come to this.&quot; Looking up he sees that it is his 
  turn to be processed into hell. With fear and a heavy heart, he walks up to 
  the counselor.</p>
<p class="words"> <strong>Counselor:</strong> What's the problem, you look depressed?</p>
<p class="words"><strong>Guy:</strong> Well, what do you think? I am in hell!!!</p>
<p class="words"><strong>Counselor:</strong> Hell isn't so bad, we actually have 
  a lot of fun. Do you like to drink?</p>

  Mondays. On Mondays we drink up a storm. You can have whiskey, rum, tequila, 
  beer, whatever you want and as much as you want. We party all night long. You'll 
  love Mondays!!! Do you smoke?</p>

  Tuesdays!!! Do you do drugs?</p>
