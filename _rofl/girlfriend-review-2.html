  Software Review</a>...<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p class="words"> From a very technically-oriented contributor.... </p>
<p class="words"> Last year a friend of mine upgraded GirlFriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 
  and found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system resources for other 
  applications. He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is spawning Child-Processes 
  which are further consuming valuable resources.</p>
<p class="words"> No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the 
  product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him 
  that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application. Not only that, 
  Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at system initialization 
  where it can monitor all other system activity. He's finding that some applications 
  such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to 
  run, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine 
  before). At installation, Wife 1.0 automatically installs undesired Plug-Ins 
  such as Mother-In-Law 55.8 and Brother-In-Law Beta release. As a consequence 
  system performance seems to diminish with each passing day.</p>
<p class="words"> Some features he'd like to see in the upcoming wife 2.0: A &quot;Don't 
  remind me again&quot; button Minimize button An install shield feature that 
  allows Wife 2.0 to be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime without 
  the loss of cache and other system resources. An option to run the network driver 
  in promiscuous mode which would allow the systems hardware probe feature to 
  have greater use.</p>
<p class="words"> I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with 
  Wife 1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many problems. 
  Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of Girlfriend 1.0. You must 
  uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 first. Other users say this is a long standing bug 
  which I should have been aware of. Apparently the versions of Girlfriend have 
  conflicts over shared use of the I/O port. You think they would have fixed such 
  a stupid bug by now. To make matters worse, The uninstall program for Girlfriend 
  1.0 doesn't work very well leaving undesirable traces of the application in 
  the system. Another annoying problem -- all versions of Girlfriend continually 
  popup annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0 </p>
<p class="words"> ***** BUG WARNING ***** </p>
<p class="words"> Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 
  1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before 
  executing a self-uninstallation. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming 
  insufficient system resources. </p>
<p class="words"> ***** BUG WORK-AROUNDS ***** </p>
<p class="words"> To avoid the above bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different 
  system and never run any file transfer applications such as Laplink 6.0. Also, 
  beware of similar shareware applications that have been known to carry viruses 
  that may affect Wife 1.0. </p>
<p class="words"> Another solution would be to run Mistress 1.0 via a UseNet provider 
  under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses which can accidentally 
  be downloaded from the UseNet.</p>
