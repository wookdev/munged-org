<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Jim and Nita Lee (Dec. 1972) </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"> 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the casa,<br>
  Not a creature was stirring -- Caramba! Que pasa?</p>
<p class="words"> Los ninos were tucked away in their camas,<br>
  Some in long underwear, some in pyjamas,</p>
<p class="words"> While hanging the stockings with mucho cuidado<br>
  In hopes that old Santa would feel obligado</p>
<p class="words"> To bring all children, both buenos and malos,<br>
  A nice batch of dulces and other regalos.</p>
<p class="words"> Outside in the yard there arose such a grito<br>
  That I jumped to my feet like a fightened cabrito.</p>
<p class="words"> I ran to the window and looked out afuera,<br>
  And who in the world do you think that it era?</p>
<p class="words"> Saint Nick in a sleigh and a big red sombrero<br>
  Came dashing along like a crazy bombero.</p>
<p class="words"> And pulling his sleigh instead of venados<br>
  Were eight little burros approaching volados.</p>
<p class="words"> I watched as they came and this quaint little hombre<br>
  Was shouting and whistling and calling by nombre:</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Ay Pancho, ay Pepe, ay Cuco, ay Beto,<br>
  Ay Chato, ay Chopo, Macuco, y Nieto!&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Then standing erect with his hands on his pecho<br>
  He flew to the top of our very own techo.</p>
<p class="words"> With his round little belly like a bowl of jalea,<br>
  He struggled to squeeze down our old chiminea,</p>
<p class="words"> Then huffing and puffing at last in our sala,<br>
  With soot smeared all over his red suit de gala,</p>
<p class="words"> He filled all the stockings with lovely regalos --<br>
  For none of the ninos had been very malos.</p>
<p class="words"> Then chuckling aloud, seeming very contento,<br>
  He turned like a flash and was gone like the viento.</p>
<p class="words"> And I heard him exclaim, and this is verdad,<br>
  Merry Christmas to all, and Feliz Navidad!</p>
