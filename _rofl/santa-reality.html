<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> PROOF that Santa can't exist:<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p class="words"><b>1)</b> No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 
  300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of 
  these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer 
  which only Santa has ever seen.</p>
<p class="words"><b>2)</b> There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in 
  the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish 
  and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million 
  according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 
  children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least 
  one good child in each.</p>
<p class="words"><b>3)</b> Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks 
  to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels 
  east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. 
  This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has</p>
<p class="words"> 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down 
  the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the 
  tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back 
  into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 
  million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we 
  know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we 
  are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 71.604 million 
  miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 
  31 hours, plus feeding etc.</p>
<p class="words">This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 
  3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made 
  vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second 
  - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="words"><b>4)</b> The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting 
  element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego 
  set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who 
  is invariably described as overweight.</p>
<p class="words">On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. 
  Even granting that &quot;flying reindeer&quot; (see point #1) pull TEN TIMES 
  the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine.</p>
<p class="words">We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even 
  counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - 
  this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="words"><b>5)</b> 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates 
  enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion 
  as a spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer 
  will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy per second each.</p>
<p class="words">In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, 
  exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their 
  wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of 
  a second. Santa,meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 
  times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) 
  would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>
<p class="words"> In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas 
  Eve, he's been vaporized by now. </p>
