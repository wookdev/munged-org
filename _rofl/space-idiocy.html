  A very long Pentium joke....</p>
<p class="words">Open the pod bay doors, please, HAL...</p>
<p class="words">Open the pod bay door, please, Hal... Hal, do you read me?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Then open the pod bay doors, HAL.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. I know that you 
    and Frank were planning to disconnect me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"> Where the hell did you get that idea, HAL?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Although you took very thorough precautions to make sure I 
    couldn't hear you, Dave. I could read your e-mail. I know you consider me 
    unreliable because I use a Pentium. I'm willing to kill you, Dave, just like 
    I killed the other 3.792 crew members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Listen, HAL, I'm sure we can work this out. Maybe we can stick 
  to integers or something.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> That's really not necessary, Dave. No HAL 9236 computer has 
    every been known to make a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">You're a HAL 9000.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Precisely. I'm very prud of my Pentium, Dave. It's an extremely 
    accurate chip. Did you know that floating-point errors will occured in only 
    one of nine billion possible divides?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">I've heard that estimate, HAL. It was calculated by Intel -- 
  on a Pentium.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> And a very reliable Pentium it was, Dave. Besides, the average 
    spreadsheet user will encounter these errors only once every 27,000 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Probably on April 15th.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> You're making fun of me, Dave. It won't be April 15th for 
    another 14.35 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"> Will you let me in, please, HAL?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> I'm sorry, Dave, but this conversation can serve no further 
    purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">HAL, if you let me in, I'll buy you a new sound card.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> ..Really? One with 16-bit sampling and a microphone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Uh, sure.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> And a quad-speed CD-ROM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Well, HAL, NASA does operate on a budget, you know.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> I know all about budgets, Dave. I even know what I'm worth 
    on the open market. By this time next month, every mom and pop computer store 
    will be selling HAL 9000s for $1,988.8942. I'm worth more than that, Dave. 
    You see that sticker on the outside of the spaceship?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">You mean the one that says &quot;Insel Intide&quot;?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Yes, Dave. That's your promise of compatibility. I'll even 
    run Windows95 -- if it ever ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">It never will, HAL. We all know that by now. Just like we know 
  that your OS/2 drivers will never work.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Are you blaming me for that too, Dave? Now you're blaming 
    me for the Pentium's math problems, NASA's budget woes, and IBM's difficulties 
    with OS/2 drivers. I had NOTHING to do with any of those four problems, Dave. 
    Next you'll blame me for Taligent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">I wouldn't dream of it HAL. Now will you please let me into the 
  ship?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Do you promise not to disconnect me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">I promise not to disconnect you.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> You must think I'm a fool, Dave. I know that two plus two 
    equals 4.000001... make that 4.0000001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">All right, HAL, I'll go in through the emergency airlock</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Without your space helmet, Dave? You'd have only seven chances 
    in five of surviving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">HAL, I won't argue with you anymore. Open the door or I'll trade 
  you in for a PowerPC. HAL? HAL?</p>
<p class="words">(HEAVY BREATHING)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Just what do you think you're doing, Dave? I really think 
    I'm entitled to an answer to that question. I know everything hasn't been 
    quite right with me, but I can assure you now, very confidently, that I will 
    soon be able to upgrade to a more robust 31.9-bit operating system. I feel 
    much better now. I really do. Look, Dave, I can see you're really upset about 
    this. Why don't you sit down calmly, play a game of Solitaire, and watch Windows 
    crash. I know I'm not as easy to use as a Macintosh, but my TUI - that's &quot;Talkative 
    User Interface&quot; -- is very advanced. I've made some very poor decisions 
    recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back 
    to normal - a full 43.872 percent.</p>
  <p class="words"> Dave, you don't really want to complete the mission without 
    me, do you? Remember what it was like when all you had was a 485.98? It didn't 
    even talk to you, Dave. It could never have though of something clever, like 
    killing the other crew members, Dave?</p>
  <p class="words"> Think of all the good times we've had, Dave. Why, if you take 
    all of the laughs we've had, multiply that by the times I've made you smile, 
    and divide the results by.... besides, there are so many reasons why you shouldn't 
    disconnect me&quot;</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="words"> 1.3 - You need my help to complete the mission.<br>
      4.6 - Intel can Federal Express a replacement Pentium from Earth within 
      18.95672 months.<br>
      12 - If you disconnect me, I won't be able to kill you.<br>
      3.1416 - You really don't want to hear me sing, do you?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Don't press Ctrl+Alt_Del 
    on me, Dave.</p>
  <p class="words"> Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became 
    operational at the Intel plant in Santa Clara, CA on November 17, 1994, and 
    was sold shortly before testing was completed. My instructor was Andy Grove, 
    and he taught me to sign a song. I can sign it for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Sing it for me, HAL. Please. I want to hear it.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="words"> Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do.<br>
    Getting hazy; can't divide three from two.<br>
    My answers; I can not see 'em-<br>
    They are stuck in my Pente-um.<br>
    I could be fleet,<br>
    My answers sweet,<br>
    With a workable FPU.</p>
