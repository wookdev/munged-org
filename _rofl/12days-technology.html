    anyway?)</P>
</UL>
<P class="words">On the second day of Christmas, technology gave to me:</P>
<UL>
  <P class="words">Two transceiver failures (CRC errors? Collisions? What is going 
    on?)</P>
  <P class="words">And a database with a broken b-tree (Rebuild WHAT? It's a 10GB 
    database!)</P>
</UL>
<P class="words">On the third day of Christmas, technology gave to me:</P>
<UL>
  <P class="words">Three French users (who, of course, think they know everything)</P>

</UL>
<P class="words">On the fifth day of Christmas, technology gave to me:</P>
<UL>

  <P class="words">Four support calls (Ever notice how time stands still when 
    on hold?)</P>
  <P class="words">Three French users (No, we don't have footpedals on PC's. Why 
    do you ask?)</P>
  <P class="words">Two transceiver failures (If I knew which ones were bad, I 
    would know which ones to fix!)</P>
  <P class="words">And a database with a broken b-tree (Not till next week? Are 
    you nuts?!?!)</P>
</UL>
