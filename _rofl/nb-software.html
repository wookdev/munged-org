<p class="words">'Twas the night before implementation and all through the house,<br>
  Not a program was working not even a browse. </p>
<p class="words"> The programmers hung by their tubes in despair,<br>
  with hopes that a miracle would soon be there.</p>
<p class="words"> The users were nestled all sung in their beds,<br>
  while visions of inquiries danced in their heads.</p>
<p class="words"> When out in the machine room there arose such a clatter,<br>
  I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.</p>
<p class="words"> And what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
  but a super programmer (with a six-pack of beer).</p>
<p class="words"> His resume glowed with experience so rare,<br>
  he turned out great code with a bit-pusher's flair.</p>
<p class="words"> More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,<br>
  and he cursed and muttered and called them by name:</p>
<p class="words"> On update! on add! on inquiry! on delete!<br>
  on batch jobs! on closing! on functions complete!</p>
<p class="words"> His eyes were glazed-over, fingers nimble and lean,<br>
  from weekends and nights in front of a screen.</p>
<p class="words"> A wink of his eye, and a twitch of his head,<br>
  soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>
<p class="words"> He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
  turning specs into code; then turned with a jerk;</p>
<p class="words"> And laying his finger upon the &quot;ENTER&quot; key,<br>
  the systems came up and worked perfectly.</p>
<p class="words"> The updates updated; the deletes, they deleted;<br>
  the inquiries inquired, and closings completed.</p>
<p class="words"> He tested each whistle, and tested each bell,<br>
  with nary an abend, and all had gone well.</p>
<p class="words"> The system was finished, the tests were concluded.<br>
  The users' last changes were even included.</p>
<p class="words"> And the user exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,<br>
  &quot;It's just what I asked for, but not what I want!&quot;</p>
