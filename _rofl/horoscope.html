<p class="words">For those of you who might dabble in astrology, I wanted to pass 
  along this horoscope. You may find it more accurate than it appears at first 
  glance. Ask some of your friends their sign, and see how it works out! </p>
<h1 class="title"> HOROSCOPE</h1>
<p class="words"><strong>AQUARIUS</strong> - Jan 21-Feb 19: You are carefree and 
  disorganized. You piss others off with your annoying habits. You are careless 
  and impractical, causing you to make the same mistakes repeatedly. People think 
  you are stupid.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>PISCES</strong> - Feb 20-Mar 20: You have an active imagination 
  and often think you are being stalked. You have minor influence over your associates 
  and people resent you for flaunting what little power you have. You lack confidence 
  and are generally a coward. Pisces people screw small animals.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>AIRES</strong> - Mar 21-Apr 20: You are the pioneer type 
  and like to take risks. You are quick tempered, scornful of advice, and hold 
  most people in contempt. You are generous with criticism but cannot stand to 
  be questioned. You are a true prick.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>TAURUS</strong> - Apr 21-May 20: You are practical and 
  persistent. You have a dogged determination to work like hell. You are stubborn 
  and inflexible. You are nothing but a goddamned communist.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>GEMINI</strong> - May 21-Jun 21: You are a quick and 
  intelligent thinker. People like you because you are bisexual. You are inclined 
  to expect too much for too little, which means you are cheap. Geminis are notorious 
  for thriving on incest.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>CANCER</strong> - Jun 22-Jul 23: You are sympathetic 
  and understanding of other people's problems. They think you are a sucker. You 
  are always putting things off, which is why you'll always be on welfare and 
  never be worth a shit.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>LEO</strong> - Jul 24-Aug 23: You consider yourself a 
  born leader, while others think you are a bully. You are vain and cannot tolerate 
  honest criticism. Your arrogance is disgusting. Leo people are thieving bastards.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>VIRGO</strong> - Aug 24-Sep 23: You are the logical type, 
  and hate disorder. This nitpicking is sickening to your friends. You are cold 
  and unemotional and often fall asleep while making love. Virgos make excellent 
  bus drivers and pimps.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>LIBRA</strong> - Sep 24-Oct 23: You are the artistic 
  type and have a difficult time with reality. You strive for balance and do not 
  like to take sides in an argument. This makes your friends think you are a fence-sitting 
  asshole. If you are a man, you are likely queer. Most Libra women are whores. 
  All Libras die of V.D. or AIDS.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>SCORPIO</strong> - Oct 24-Nov 22: You are shrewd in business 
  and seize any opportunity to fuck your fellow man. You shall achieve the pinnacle 
  of success because of your total lack of ethics. You are the perfect Son-of-a-bitch. 
  Most Scorpios are murdered.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>SAGITTARIUS</strong> - Nov 23-Dec 21: You are optimistic 
  and enthusiastic, with a &quot;never say die&quot; attitude. You have a tendency 
  to rely on luck since you lack talent of any kind. The majority of Sagittarians 
  are drunkards or dope fiends. People laugh at you because you are a constantly 
  getting fucked.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>CAPRICORN</strong> - Dec 22-Jan 20: You are conservative 
  and afraid of taking risks. You really don't do much of anything and are lazy. 
  There has never been a Capricorn of any importance. Capricorns should avoid 
  standing still for any length of time since they tend to attract pigeons. If 
  you died tomorrow, your friends wouldn't notice for several weeks, if at all.</p>
