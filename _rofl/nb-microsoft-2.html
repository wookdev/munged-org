<blockquote>
  <p> by Walter Miller December 24, 1997</p>
  <p class="words"> With apologies to Clement C. Moore. Walter is enjoying his<br>
    new Christmas gift of a Spell Checker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">   'Twas the night before Christmas across cyberspace<br>
  Not a .JPEG was loading of Princess Di's face</p>
<p class="words">   The servers were humming, the line noise was nil<br>
  Even the X-rated newsgroups were still</p>
<p class="words">   I yawned and I dozed at my desk with despair<br>
  Ignoring emergency calls for repair</p>
<p class="words">   (I'd come into work with lethargic designs --<br>
  I was supposed to be manning the tech support lines.)</p>
<p class="words">   So with no other noise than my CPU fan,<br>
  I'd just settled down to play Quake on the lan</p>
<p class="words">   When there right above me I heard such a ruckus<br>
  I fell from my chair and right onto my tuchas</p>
<p class="words">   The foam ceiling tiles, they buckled and tore<br>
  They suddenly broke, and then onto the floor...</p>
<p class="words">   ...Fell a tall skinny guy in a loose Santa suit<br>
  With a bag in his hand that he loaded with loot.</p>
<p class="words">   I know you!&quot; I shrieked, &quot;But why are you here?&quot;<br>
  Where's Santa? And Rudolph? And all the reindeer?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">   He grinned at me, &quot;Christmas has changed just a bit.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The red suit's now owned by a Redmond outfit,</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;The fat guy is out. ('Twas a big fan of Apple).<br>
  The others, outsourced into venison scrapple.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;What used to be Christmas,&quot; he smirked, &quot;Now is 
  mine!<br>
  I'll fight every lawsuit, I'll pay every fine!</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;I've bought all the rights and renamed it you see:<br>
  To 'MS Noel, One-point-0 for NT!'&quot;</p>
<p class="words">   Hearing these words I collapsed, all perplexed<br>
  (Kwaanza and Hanukkah surely were next.)</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;As long as you're here,&quot; I said, barely alive,<br>
  &quot;Can you at least help me de-bug this Win 95?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;No time!&quot; he cried, plunging ahead with attack,<br>
  And stuffed my whole workstation into his sack.</p>
<p class="words">   He left behind only my cubicle's phone,<br>
  Yet one day, the telcos as well he will own.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;Will MS Noel run on Netscape?&quot; I wondered<br>
  &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he mused, &quot;After they too I have plundered.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;So bring on my enemies! Bring on my foes!<br>
  (And others who make software too, I suppose)</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;Come Reno! Come Nader! Come all legal action!<br>
  On Congress! On District Judge Thomas P. Jackson!</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;A million a day? That is it? That is all?<br>
  I'll pay it up! Take 'em on! Beat 'em back all!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">   And then, at that instant, he flew from the room<br>
  (up to our management wing, I assume)</p>
<p class="words">   A shiny new CD he'd left on my chair.<br>
  I still had my laptop -- but yet, would I dare?</p>
<p class="words">   And truly install this new MS Noel?<br>
  All right, I will do it! OK, what the hell!</p>
<p class="words">   I popped in the disc and booted the thing<br>
  Suspicious of what the new Christmas would bring</p>
<p class="words">   Two avatars sprang up, 'tween Task and Bookshelf(TM),<br>
  'Twas Ballmer and Myhrvold, each dressed like an elf</p>
<p class="words">   My processor strained as they bobbed and they beckoned<br>
  In slow loading spasms of 2 bytes per second</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;New and Improved!&quot; They cried, &quot;Bigger than Big!&quot;<br>
  (Christmas now takes up a whole half a gig)</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;We've downloaded all of your personal data!<br>
  We know you like fruitcake! Surprised? Whatsamatta?</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;We've poked through your sessions, we've peeked and we've 
  gandered<br>
  To force your compliance to industry standard</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;Repeat after us: 'Ho Ho Ho:' That's the Word(TM)!<br>
  Resistance is futile, haven't you heard?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">   And suddenly then, my whole screen just went blank<br>
  Who should I blame? (Or else, who should I thank?)</p>
<p class="words">   An error screen popped up, right out of the blue<br>
  With &quot;A Word From Our Chairman&quot; (That's &quot;Santa&quot; to you):</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;An update dispatch from the Redmond North Pole:<br>
  We're sorry to tell you, 'Noel' is on hold.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;It's loaded with bugs, and Marketing's balking<br>
  Legal threw up on it; Research is walking.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;All of these problems, of course must be reckoned<br>
  So Christmas is pushed off till March 22nd.</p>
<p class="words">   &quot;Let Reno and Justice gear up for the fight...<br>
  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good...<br>
  ...a good...<br>
    ...Um, how 'bout a good evening or a good nocturne,&quot;<br>
    
  mumbled Santa to his bored, tired, frightened staff  back there at the 
  North Pole. &quot;As long as it's a bigger  word that doesn't rhyme, 
  because rhyming shouldn't  really be an industry standard for poems. 
  It wastes  time and is irrational, and besides, after we buy the 
   rights to this classic poem, add a few thousand strings  of code 
  to it and demand that OEM vendors bundle MS Noel  along with Explorer 
  4.0 as an integral part of the OS,  then blah, blah, blah...&quot;</p>
