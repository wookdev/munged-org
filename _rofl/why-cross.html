  So that its subjects will view it with admiration, as a chicken which has the

  them has the strength to contend with such a paragon of avian virtue? In such 
  a manner is the princely chicken's dominion maintained.</p>
<p class="words">Tomas de Torquemada:<br>
  Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I'll find out.</p>

<p class="words">Karl Marx:<br>
  It was a historical inevitability.</p>

  In order to act in good faith and be true to itself, the chicken found it necessary 
  to cross the road.</p>
<p class="words">Ludwig Wittgenstein:<br>
  The possibility of &quot;crossing&quot; was encoded into the objects &quot;chicken&quot;

  Forty-two.</p>
<p class="words">Stephen Jay Gould:<br>
  It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation for it, but we have 
  been deluged in recent years with sociobiological stories despite the fact that 
  we have little direct evidence about the genetics of behavior, and we do not 
  know how to obtain it for the specific behaviors that figure most prominently 
  in sociobiological speculation.</p>

  National Security was at stake.</p>
<p class="words">Ronald Reagan:<br>

  'Cause it f*cking wanted to. That's the f*cking reason.</p>
<p class="words">Saddam Hussein:<br>
  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion, and we were quite justified in dropping 
  50 tons of nerve gas on it.</p>
<p class="words">Andersen Consultant:<br>
  Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its dominant 
  market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create 
  and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen 
  Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken 
  by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. 
  Using the Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its 
  skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken's 
  people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a 
  Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum 
  of road analysts and best chickens along with Andersen consultants with deep 
  skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings 
  in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, 
  and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit 
  goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide 
  value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The 
  meeting was held in a park-like setting enabling and creating an impactful environment 
  which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, 
  clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, 
  and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business 
  integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken change to become 
  more successful.</p>
