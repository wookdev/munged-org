<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p class="words"><strong>ARIES</strong> (March 21-April 20):This month the bull-headed 
  ram charges straight into trouble. Be extra careful with motion on the third. 
  Tell the police it wasn't your fault. A moonchild on the jury will acquit.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>TAURUS</strong> (April 21-May 21):Venus in your house 
  of money spells a new career for you, Taurean. Looks like you'll be working 
  those mean streets for a while--but the money will be mmm-mmm, good! Try to 
  find a nice Leo pimp to keep an eye out while you bring home the bacon. On the 
  other hand, if you're a man, you're going to prison. Tough break.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>GEMINI</strong> (May 22-June 21):All Geminis are two-faced 
  scum, especially my ex-boyfriend. DIE DIE DIE, you lousy bastard! A Capricorn 
  native will dance on your grave.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>CANCER</strong> (June 22-July 23): This month, sensitive 
  Cancer is more sensitive than usual. Mercury transiting your natal Scorpio turns 
  you into a rotten, unpleasant bitch. Others will notice and comment. Your first 
  instinct will be to act out that Mars in Taurus urge to strike back. Sit down 
  and shut up instead. Nobody wants to hear it. Pay particular attention to advice 
  given by a Leo on the twentieth. Re-think that parole violation you're contemplating.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>LEO</strong> (July 24-Aug 23): Your leonine charms serve 
  you particularly well this month, especially on the 31st, when you have a good 
  chance to use the persuasive influence of the Moon transiting your natal Scorpio 
  to find the willing sacrifice of your dreams. Careful, though! A law-abiding 
  Libra wants to spoil your fun! You're the king of the jungle, though, Leo--so 
  just kill the interfering bastard and get on with the show!</p>
<p class="words"><strong>VIRGO</strong> (Aug 24-Sept 23): It's official. There 
  aren't any left.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>LIBRA</strong> (Sept 24-Oct 23): Aren't you the birthday 
  boy or girl? And aren't you making a pain of yourself by reminding everyone 
  that you're turning another year older? The wise old Moon in your house of communication 
  says shut up and let people remember on your own. The Leos, of course, will 
  forget, since they're busy thinking about themselves. But--trust me-- it's best 
  to steer clear of Leo this month. Besides, if people forget-- so what? You could 
  use some humility--you're the biggest pain in the ass in the zodiac, Libra. 
  Lighten up.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>SCORPIO</strong> (Oct 24-Nov 22): Watch out for the impending 
  Second Coming. Your underhanded schemes are about to fall apart. A Capricorn 
  native plays a big part. Things heat up near the end of October, when Neptune 
  transits your natal Saturn, sealing your eternal doom. Sell all your possessions 
  in the second week of October. You won't be needing them again.</p>
<p class="words"><strong>SAGITTARIUS</strong> (Nov 23-Dec 21): Uh-oh. Somebody 
  found out where that last arrow landed. Expect a visit from Oliver Stone. And 
  beware of the Great Green Dragon. A last-minute reprieve comes from a Piscean, 
  possibly the one you drowned last month. </p>
<p class="words"><strong>CAPRICORN</strong> (Dec 22-Jan 20):Truly the jewel of 
  the zodiac, the goat, as always, is in fine form this month. A number of unpleasant 
  folks from the past mysteriously disappear from the spotlight, leaving you free 
  to get on with your bright future. Neptune finally moves out of your twelfth 
  house of the subconscious, enabling you to emerge from the schizophrenic haze 
  you've been living in for so long. Stop taking your medication. It's just a 
  plot by Pisceans to control you. The voices were right all along. </p>
<p class="words"><strong>AQUARIUS</strong> (Jan 21-Feb 19): As the new moon sets 
  in, expect new opportunities to come with it. Your water breaks on October tenth. 
</p>
<p class="words"><strong>PISCES</strong> (Feb 20-March 20): Maybe you shouldn't 
  leave the house this month. There are some real weirdos loose in the zodiac 
  during the next 30 days. Better to hide in the cellar until November. Oh, wait. 
  I just took a glance at November. I'll get back to you. Stay low.</p>
