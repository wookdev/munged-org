<p>The International Typographer's Association has announced an impending shortage 
  of exclamation marks (sometimes affectionately known as&quot;bangs&quot;). These 
  poor, put-upon points of punctuation have been overworked in too many pieces 
  of prose and programming alike, causing the previously plentiful population 
  to diminish perilously.</p>
<p>All writers of C code and other works of art are asked to help avert the oncoming 
  crisis by substituting other symbols for the exclamation mark. In C, this can 
  be done by using the word NOT instead. To illustrate, we'll have to sacrifice 
  just a few of the brave creatures:</p>
<pre>        if (! a)		/* Old */
becomes
        if (NOT a)		/* New */</pre>
<p>In fact, since this works so well in C, it can be carried over to English as 
  well. Rather than obscuring the meaning of many sentences, it can help make 
  them even more accurate. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The Windigent OS release 42 offers much higher performance and better portability 
    than any other operating system!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>becomes</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The Windigent OS release 42 offers much higher performance and better portability 
    than any other operating system NOT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please start using this system today NOT With your help, we can help save our 
  precious bangs for future generations NOT</p>
