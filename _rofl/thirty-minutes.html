<p>For decades, two heroic statues, one male and one female, faced each other 
  in a city park, until one day an angel came down from heaven. </p>
<p>&quot;You've been such exemplary statues,&quot; he announced to them, &quot;That 
  I'm going to give you a special gift. I'm going to bring you both to life for 
  thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want.&quot; And with a clap 
  of his hands, the angel brought the statues to life. </p>
<p>The two approached each other a bit shyly, but soon dashed for the bushes, 
  from which shortly emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of 
  branches. Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged from the bushes, wide 
  grins on their faces. </p>
<p>&quot;You still have fifteen more minutes,&quot; said the angel, winking at 
  them. </p>
<p>Grinning even more widely the female statue turned to the male statue and said, 
  &quot;Great! Only this time you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on it's head.&quot;</p>
