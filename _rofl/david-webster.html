<p class="words"> Heaven's donuts are jelly donuts. The blend of texture, from 
  the
  cool, sweet ooze of the jelly, mined with tiny raspberry seeds, to the
  firm, spongy cake, so lightly encrusted in a thin glaze of sugar, that
  cracks and flakes as you gingerly tear off small pieces of delight, is
  certainly the greatest experience a humble man can afford.
</p>
<p class="words"> I was eating a jelly donut when he first appeared in my office,
  smelling slightly of gunpowder. He was tall and gaunt, with deep-set
  eyes and crooked teeth, long, delicate fingers, and sloped shoulders.
  He wore a black Ozzy Osborne concert t-shirt, frayed black jeans, and
  dusty black high-tops, unlaced. He smiled at me in an ugly way. I
  put down my donut and glanced at my watch. 7:00 PM.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;You're David Webster.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I nodded.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;You're a programmer for Core.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I nodded again. Not only was I a programmer for Core--I was 
  the
  best damn programmer this group had ever or would ever see. I suppose
  I should introduce myself. I am David Elijah Webster, master
  programmer. I'm not just blowing smoke here either. I'm the best
  damn programmer to come out of MIT since code was constructed one bit
  at a time. I can do it all: C, LISP, assembly--even the languages no
  self-respecting programmer would deign to look at. I can do it all in
  no time flat, with the most elegant of style. Code sprinkled with
  glistening semicolons and flowing rivers of indentation. Lesser
  programmers avert their eyes when I enter the room.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;They say you're the best, and I'm here to challenge you.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I sized this guy up again. He had the right shape. The pot-belly,
  the greasy hair, parted with precision. The fingers. And the funny
  smell.
</p>
<p class="words"> I told him I didn't have time.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I'll make it worth your while,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
  have something you might
  be interested in. Follow me.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I grabbed my box of donuts, and followed him down the hall and 
  into
  the elevator. He pressed a button and the elevator descended into the
  basement. I'd never been in the basement before. For that matter, I
  didn't even recall that the building had a basement. Nonetheless, the
  elevator chimed, the doors opened, and we stepped out into a wide room
  that was entirely featureless. That is, except for the fog on the
  floor and two workstations that were set up, side by side. One of the
  workstations was mine. The other was a workstation like none other
  that I had seen before. It was magnificent.
</p>
<p class="words"> It was matte black. More than an object, it looked like a hole 
  in
  space. The monitor it sported was the biggest I had ever seen, and
  the keyboard was a flow of liquid lines, containing a field of keys of
  different sizes and shapes, packed in like cobblestones. The mouse
  floated above the table, and had no wire. Next to the computer was a
  box with a small chute coming out of one side, and a large red button
  on the top. The monitor was flanked by two gigantic speakers, and I
  could see a sub-woofer poking up out of the fog. It hummed. It
  steamed. It was the most beautiful computer I had ever seen.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;You approve,&quot; said the stranger.
</p>
<p class="words"> I swallowed and said, &quot;It is beyond description.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;It's a custom job. And it's yours. If,&quot; he said, 
  &quot;If you can beat
  me in a coding contest.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I looked at him incredulously. &quot;What's in it for you?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I will have defeated the greatest coder in the world, 
  and thus, I can
  claim that title. AND, I get to keep your immortal soul.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> He smiled the ugly smile again.
</p>
<p class="words"> Here was a dilemma. I was dealing with the Devil. There was 
  no doubt
  about that. And he was no doubt very good. I am somewhat attached to
  my soul, but oh, the prizes. The glory. I can easily claim to be the
  best coder in the company, in the Bay Area, probably on the whole
  planet, but if I pulled this off, I will have shown myself to be the
  best coder in this entire theology! Vanity got the better part of me.
</p>
<p class="words">&quot;What's the contest?&quot; I asked.
</p>
<p class="words">I won't bore you with the details, but it was seriously ugly. 
  Ugly in
  a way that makes the most arrogant of coders cringe and causes
  managers to pad development schedules into the next century. It had
  to run in any language, including the nasty chicken-scratch ones. It
  had to be backward compatible all the way to the ENIAC. And it had to
  run on Windows. I cringed.
</p>
<p class="words"> But vanity won. I signed the forms, agreed on a deadline of 
  midnight,
  and we sat down at our machines and started to code.
</p>
<p class="words"> My watch said 8:00 PM, and I started warming up. Class definitions
  flew off my fingertips like throwing stars. Structures and
  declarations grew like perfect crystals, and I didn't even break a
  sweat. True to the task, I soon lost myself in an endless cycle of
  postulate, create, instantiate and verify. Bits grew to bytes, to K,
  to Megs, and finally to Gigs. By 11:00 PM it had come to that crucial
  point. With an hour to go, I had to put all the pieces together. It
  wasn't going to be easy. It was going to take all the concentration I
  had.
</p>
<p class="words"> Then I hit the first bug.
</p>
<p class="words"> At first, I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but then I 
  spotted
  it. It wasn't mine. It was bug in Windows. Even worse, it was a bug
  in Windows that stemmed from a timing problem with the system clock
  itself. I couldn't see a workaround. I was stymied. I genuflected
  and called Microsoft support.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Hello, and welcome to the Microsoft help line. Please 
  enter your 64
  digit user identification number, followed by your 32 digit password.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> While I frantically typed number after number, trying to navigate
  through layer upon layer of phone menu, I heard him pick up his phone
  and call a number.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Hello, is Bill in? ... I don't care, wake him up ... Tell 
  him it's
  Mr. Black ... Hey Bill, what's shakin'? Listen, I needed to know a
  workaround to one of your bugs ... Yes, I know what time it is
  ..... Yes, I know ... Bill ... Bill! You remember our little deal?
  ..... That's right. Now be a dear and give me that workaround ... Mm-hm
  ..... Right ... Thank you, Bill. I'll be seeing you.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I was shocked. It was obviously pointless continuing my desperate
  journey through Microsoft's Help line. I needed immediate genius! I
  scarfed down a grape jelly. Sugar shock engulfed me, and my vision
  tunneled. I shuddered once, something clicked, and I determined the
  answer I needed--I could use the clock on the sound chip to get my
  timings.
</p>
<p class="words">I dove back into the code, and was quickly integrating modules 
  when
  I hit bug number two. It was even uglier than the first. In fact, it
  was the ugliest bug I had ever seen. It was a problem with C. With
  the language itself. There's no way fix a broken hammer using the
  same hammer.
</p>
<p class="words"> I wracked my brains. I clenched and grunted and sweated and 
  thought
  and Thought and THOUGHT, but to no avail. Over my shoulder, I could
  hear Him chime in, &quot;Bugger, isn't it? I remember putting that one in
  back when I was working on the Unix kernel. Did you really think
  there was a Kernighan and Ritchie? Rearrange the letters in their
  names and you'll discover an interesting anagram.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> I ignored him and continued thinking. My mind went deeper and 
  deeper
  into the problem at hand--my senses dulled, my breathing grew shallow.
  My eyes rolled back and sweat beaded on my forehead. Clumsily,
  blindly, my hand pawed it's way to the box on my desk, containing my
  last jelly donut. It raised slowly to my lips, and I bit.
</p>
<p class="words"> Pounding waves of sugar induced euphoria washed through my mind. 
  I
  felt my brain hum and crackle. My hands trembled, my body shuddered,
  and I began to type. I was a man possessed. Complex topographical
  math equations formed on my screen. Klien bottles and hypercubes
  locked neatly into place like pieces of a puzzle. Beyond my control,
  a complex mathematical world formed in my computer, with additional
  dimensions unimaginable.
</p>
<p class="words"> I felt a small pop, and I came to. I looked at my screen. I 
  had
  worked around the bug.
</p>
<p class="words"> My watch read 11:45. Frantically I continued putting all the 
  modules
  into place. Glancing for a moment at my rival, I could see I had him
  worried. He was typing furiously. Smoke poured from his ears, and
  flames licked around his collar.
</p>
<p class="words"> Then I hit the third bug.
</p>
<p class="words"> It was not so much a bug, it was a limit. I only had 4 Gigabytes 
  of
  memory, and I had used it all. There wasn't a bit left. I had
  compressed data to a point so fine that it was in danger of collapsing
  into a black hole. I was storing memory in every conceivable way,
  including keeping a chain of sound waves running between the speaker
  and the microphone. There was no memory left to be had.
</p>
<p class="words">Frantic, I reached into my box of donuts, and my heart sank into 
  my
  stomach when I realized that I had eaten the last one. I glanced at
  my watch, but it was too late. I was sunk. I had done the best that
  I could, and I had nothing more to give.
</p>
<p class="words"> The Devil laughed, and grinning cruelly, he reached over to 
  the box
  with the chute and the button. Remember the box? Slowly, firmly, his
  hand pressed the red button, and a jelly donut slid down the chute and
  onto the table.
</p>
<p class="words"> My jaw dropped. &quot;What...is...that?&quot; I asked.
</p>
<p class="words"> He languorously chewed as he replied, &quot;The Box of Eternal 
  Donuts.&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;The Box of Eternal Donuts!?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Yes,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;It never runs out?&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Never,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;It's mine if I win?!?!&quot;
</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;If you can win, it is entirely yours,&quot; he replied, 
  grinning cockily.
  My mind reeled. The Box of Eternal Donuts. The Box of Eternal
  Donuts! My eyes darted everywhere, my jaw hung slack, and my throat
  emitted strange animal-like noises. Anything. I would do anything to
  win! I just needed the smallest amount of memory. But where could I
  get it from? I glanced at my watch again, and a plan came into my mind.
  A beautiful, devious plan.
</p>
<p class="words"> I went quickly upstairs and retrieved the emergency toolkit 
  that we
  keep in the medicine cabinet. I ripped the case off my computer, and
  quickly scanned for the right connections. I pulled two wires, and
  unscrewed the back of my watch. The Devil's eyes widened and he
  desperately started coding again, but it was too late. I got the last
  of the memory I needed out of my watch, and pressed the ENTER key
  seconds before he did.
</p>
<p class="words"> The watch burst into flames. Sparks flew from the disk drives 
  and
  the monitor glowed and throbbed, finally melting into a puddle
  of glass. The computer exploded in a shower of sparks, and then there
  was absolute silence.
</p>
<p class="words"> There was a pause, and both of us turned as the printer started,
  slowly emitting a single sheet that wafted gently into the out bin. I
  nonchalantly strolled over, and held up to the Devil's scowling face,
  a sheet imprinted with two words. &quot;Hello World&quot;.
</p>
<p class="words"> Nothing more needs to be told, other than, as I write this, 
  I am
  sitting in front of my new computer, munching on what is undoubtedly
  the best jelly donut I have ever eaten.
