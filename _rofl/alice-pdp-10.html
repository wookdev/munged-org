<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> With thanks (and apologies) to Chris Stacy, Alan Wechsler, 
    Noel Chiappa, Larry Allen, and of course Arlo Guthrie, and particularly to 
    Ann Marie Finn who is a kind soul and not at all like the person portrayed 
    herein. --sra 3 May 85 </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">This song is called &quot;Alice's PDP-10&quot;. But Alice doesn't 
  own a PDP-10,
  in fact Alice isn't even in the song. It's just the name of the song.
  That's why I called this song &quot;Alice's PDP-10&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">You see, it all started about two incompatible monitor versions 
  ago,
  about two months ago on a Tuesday, when my friend and I SUPDUP'd over
  to MIT-OZ to pick up some hackers to go out for a Chinese dinner. But
  AI hackers don't live on MIT-OZ, they live on various assorted lispms
  and such, and seeing as and how they never log in except via the file
  server, they hadn't gotten around to doing filesystem garbage
  collection for a long time.</p>
<p class="words">We got over there, saw 600 pages free, 10000 pages in use on 
  a 5 pack
  PS:, and decided it would be a friendly gesture to run CHECKD for them
  and try to reclaim some of that lost space. So we reloaded the system
  with the floppies and the switch registers and other implements of
  destruction, and answered &quot;Y&quot; to RUN CHECKD?</p>
<p class="words">But when we got the system up and tried to release all the lost 
  pages there was a loud beeping and a big message flashed up on our screen saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">PERMISSION DENIED BY ACJ</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Well, we'd never heard of a version of ACJ that would let you 
  go into
  MDDT from ANONYMOUS but not run CHECKD, and so, with tears in our
  eyes, we headed off over the Chaosnet looking for a filesystem with
  enough free pages to write out the LOST-PAGES.BIN file. Didn't find
  one...</p>
<p class="words">Until we got to XX-11, and at the other end of XX-11 was another 
  MIT
  Twenex, and in PS:&lt;OPERATOR&gt; on that MIT Twenex was another
  LOST-PAGES.BIN file. And we decided that one big LOST-PAGES.BIN file
  was better than two little LOST-PAGES.BIN file, and rather than page
  that one in we thought we'd write ours out. So that's what we did.</p>
<p class="words">Went back to OZ, found some hackers and went out for a Chinese 
  dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next morning when 
  we got a SEND from Ann Marie Finn. She said, &quot;Kid, we found your initials 
  in SIXBIT in the right half of a POPJ at the end of a two
  megaword core dump full of garbage, just wanted to know if you had any
  information about it&quot;. And I said, &quot;Yes ma'am Ann Marie, I cannot 
  tell
  a lie, I put that XUNAME into that halfword&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">After talking back and forth with Ann for about 45 messages we 
  arrived
  at the truth of the matter and Ann said that we had to go rebuild the
  bittable and we also had to come down and talk to her in room
  NE43-501. Now friends, there was only one of two things that Ann
  could of done with us down at room 501, and the first one was that she
  could have hired us on the spot for actually knowing enough about
  Twenex to screw it up that badly, which wasn't very likely and we
  didn't expect it, and the other was that she could have bawled us out
  and told us never to be seen hacking filesystems again, which was what
  we expected. But when we got to room 501 we discovered that there was
  a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both
  immediately de-wheeled. CD%DIR'ed. And I said &quot;Ann, I don't think I
  can rebuild the bittable with this here FILES-ONLY bit set.&quot; And she
  said &quot;XOFF, kid, get into this UDP packet&quot; and that's what we did 
  and
  rode up to the square bracket asciz slash scene of the crime slash
  close square bracket.</p>
<p class="words">Now friends, I want to tell you about the ninth floor of building 
  NE43
  where this happened. They got three KL10s, 24 LISPMs, and about 32
  VAXen running 4.2 unix. But when we got to the square bracket asciz
  slash scene of the crime slash close square bracket there was five
  twenex hackers past and present, this being the biggest lossage yet by
  an RMS clone and everybody wanted to get in their suggestion for a new
  system daemon that would have kept it from ever having happened in the
  first place. And they was using up all kinds of debugging equipment
  that they had lying around on V3A SWSKIT tapes. They were doing DSs,
  MONRDs, and RSTRSHs, and they made 27000 pages of core dumps and photo
  files on an RP06 with comments and -READ-.-THIS- files to be used as
  evidence against us.</p>
<p class="words">After the ordeal, Ann took us back downstairs and left us with 
  the CLU
  hackers. She said &quot;Kid, I'm gonna leave you with the CLU hackers. I
  want your jsys manual and your ROLM DTI&quot;. I said &quot;Ann, I can
  understand your wanting my jsys manual so I won't remind the CLU
  hackers of grody things like operating systems, but what do you want
  my DTI for?&quot; and she said &quot;Kid, we don't want any VTS errors&quot;. 
  I said
  &quot;Ann, did you think I was going to try to crash the system for
  littering?&quot; Ann said that she was making sure, and friends, Ann was,
  'cause she cleared all my left-hand privs bits so I couldn't logout.
  And she disabled the TREPLACE command so I couldn't crock in an
  XCT [0] instruction, cause an illegal instruction interrupt to MEXEC,
  and sneak into MDDT. Yeah, Ann was making sure, and it was about four
  or five hours later that Chiappa (remember Chiappa? This song's never
  even mentioned Chiappa) Chiappa came by and with a few gratuitous
  insults to the CLU hackers bailed us out of there, and we went out and
  had another Chinese dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up
  until the next morning when we all had to go to LCS Computational
  Resources staff meeting.</p>
<p class="words">We walked in, sat down. Ann came in with the RP06 disk pack with 
  the
  27000 pages with the comments and the -READ-.-THIS- files and a two
  liter coffee mug, sat down. Esther Felix comes in says &quot;All rise&quot;, 
  we
  stood up, Ann stood up with the 27000 page RP06 pack, and Dave Clark
  comes in with an IBM PC. He sits down, we sit down, Ann looks at the
  IBM PC. Then at the 27000 page RP06 pack, then at the IBM PC, then at
  the 27000 page RP06 pack, and began to cry, because Ann had come to
  the realization that it was a typical case of 36%8==4 and that there
  was no way to display those last four bits, and that Dave wasn't gonna
  look at the 27000 pages of core dumps and photo files on the RP06 pack
  with the comments and -READ-.-THIS- files explaining what each one was
  to be used as evidence against us.</p>
<p class="words">And we were permanently assigned to the batch dregs queue and 
  had to
  rebuild the bittable (in the batch dregs queue). But that's not what
  I came here to talk about. I came here to talk about DEC.</p>
<hr size="2" noshade>
<p class="words">They got a building up there in Marlboro where you walk in and 
  get
  averted, diverted, inverted, reverted, and perverted. I went up there
  one day to pick up a new copy of the tools tape. Drove down to Philly
  for a Greatful Dead concert the night before, so I looked and felt my
  best when I went in that morning. 'Cause I wanted to look like a real
  live twenex hacker from MIT. I wanted to feel like, I wanted to be a
  real live twenex hacker from MIT. I walked in and I was hung down,
  brung down, hung up, and spaced out. The receptionist hands be a
  piece of paper saying &quot;Kid, the EDIT-20 maintainers are polling user
  opinions today and would like you to stop by room 604 while you're
  here.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">I walked in there and I said &quot;Droids, I want to lose. I 
  mean, I want
  to lose. I want to see line editors on CRTs and nulls in my files.
  Write 36 bit ascii that can't be read except with the monitor
  filtering it. I mean LOSE, LOSE, LOSE!&quot; And I started jumping up and
  down yelling &quot;LOSE, LOSE&quot;, and Kevin Paetzold came in wearing his
  moose ear hat and started jumping up and down with me yelling &quot;LOSE,
  LOSE&quot;, and a DEC sales rep came over, put an arm around my shoulder,
  and said &quot;How'd you like me to show you a *real* editor that has
  macros and things like that? We have one, it's called TV....&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Didn't feel too good about it.</p>
<p class="words">Proceeded on down the hall getting more diversions and perversions.
  Man, I was in there for two hours, three hours, four hours, I was in
  there for a long time, and they was doing all kinds of mean nasty ugly
  things, and I was just having a tough time there. They was diverting
  and inverting every single part of me and they was leaving no bit
  untouched.</p>
<p class="words">Finally I got to the very last office (I'd been in all the rest), 
  the
  very last desk, after that whole big thing there, and I walk over and
  say &quot;what do you want?&quot; and the man says &quot;Kid, we only got one
  question: have you ever been dewheeled?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">So I proceeded to tell him the story of the 10600 page five pack 
  PS:
  with full orchestration and five part harmony and other phenomena and
  he stopped me right there and said &quot;Kid, did you ever get hauled on
  the carpet for it?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">So I proceeded to tell him about the 27000 page RP06 pack with 
  the
  comments and the -READ-.-THIS- files and he stopped me right there and
  said &quot;Kid, I want you to go sit over there on that bench marked Large
  Systems SIG. NOW, KID!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">I, I walked over to the bench there... See, the LCG group is 
  where
  they put you if they think you may not be compatible with the rest of
  DEC's product line.</p>
<p class="words">There was all kinds of mean nasty ugly people there on the bench...
  Chaosnet designers... Lisp hackers... TECO hackers. TECO hackers
  right there on the bench with me! And the meanest one of them, the
  hairiest TECO hacker of them all was coming over to me. And he was
  mean and nasty and horrible and undocumented and all kinds of stuff.
  And he sat down next to me and said:</p>
<p class="words">[1:i*^Yu14&lt;q1&amp;377.f&quot;nir'q1/400.u1&gt;[8
  .-z(1702117120m81869946983m8w660873337m8w1466458484m8
  )+z,.f^@fx*[0:ft^]0w^\</p>
<p class="words">And I said &quot;I didn't get nothing, I had to rebuild the bittable 
  in
  queue six&quot; and he said:</p>
<p class="words">[1:i*^Yu16&lt;q1&amp;77.+32iq1f&quot;l#-1/100.#-1&amp;7777777777.'&quot;#/100.'u1r&gt;6c[6

<p class="words">And I said &quot;Littering&quot;. And they all moved away from 
  me on the bench
  there, with the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty ugly stuff
  until I said &quot;and making undocumented gratuitous changes to the
  default EMACS key bindings&quot;. And they all came back, shook my hand,
  and we had a great time on the bench talking about Chaosnet hacking
  and Lisp interpreters written in TECO, and everything was fine. And
  we were eating Peking ravs and smoking all kinds of things until the
  guy from DDC came over, had some paper in his hand, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">KIDS-THIS-SPR-FORM-HAS-FIFTY-EIGHT-LINES-THIRTY-SEVEN-BOXES-AN'-SIXTY-EIGHT-QUESTIONS-WE-WANT-TO-KNOW-THE-DETAILS-OF-THE-BUG-THE-LOAD-FACTOR-WHEN-IT-HAPPENED-AND-ANY-OTHER-KIND-OF-THING-YOU-GOT-TO-SAY-WE-WANT-TO-KNOW-THE-F-S-GUY'S-NAME-AND-HOW-MANY-TRACKS-ON-YOUR-TAPE-DRIVE-AND-ANY-OTHER-KIND-OF-THING-YOU-GOT-TO-SAY-...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">and he talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a 
  word
  that he said or why we were doing this but we had fun filling out the
  forms in triplicate and speculating on why we were filling out SPRs on
  unsupported products.</p>
<p class="words">I filled out the special form with the four-level macro defining
  macros. Typed it in there just like it was and everything was fine.
  And I put down my keyboard, and I switched buffers, and there ... in
  the other buffer... centered in the other buffer... away from
  everything else in the buffer... in parentheses, capital letters, in
  reverse video, read the following words:</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Kid, have you taken the ``VMS for TOPS-20 managers'' course 
  yet?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">I walked over to the man and I said &quot;Mister, you got a lot 
  of damned
  gall asking me if I've taken the ``VMS for TOPS-20 managers'' course
  yet. I mean... I mean... I mean, I'm sitting here on the bench, I'm
  sitting here on the LCG SIG bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm
  braindamaged enough trade my PDP-10 for partial credit on a system
  that doesn't even handle filename completion after being a litterbug.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">He looked at me and said &quot;Kid, the front office don't like 
  your kind,
  so we're going to put you on our VAX/VMS mailing list.&quot; And friends,
  somewhere down in the NE43 receiving room is a large trash barrel with
  a big sign on it that says &quot;VAX/VMS documents&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">And the only reason I'm singing you the song now is that someday
  you may know somebody in a similar situation... or you may be in a
  similar situation. And if you're in a situation like that there's
  only one thing you can do, and that's call up the Digital Educational
  Services office nearest you and sing &quot;You can hack anything you want
  with TECO and DDT&quot; and hang up.</p>
<p class="words">You know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may think 
  he's
  really dangerous and they won't take his machine.</p>
<p class="words">And if two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both 
  ITS
  hackers and they won't touch either of them.</p>
<p class="words">And if three people do it! Can you imagine three people calling 
  up,
  singin' a bar of &quot;Alice's PDP-10&quot; and hanging up? They may think it's
  an re-implementation of the Chaosnet protocol.</p>
<p class="words">And can you imagine fifty people a day? I said FIFTY people a 
  day,
  calling up, singin' a bar of &quot;Alice's PDP-10&quot; and hanging up?
  Friends, they may think it's a MOVEMENT, and that's what it is: THE
  36-BIT ANTI-LOSSAGE MOVEMENT! And all you gotta do to join is to sing
  it the next time it comes up to the head of the GOLST.</p>
<p class="words">With feelin'.</p>
<p class="words"> You can hack anything you want, with TECO and DDT.<br>
  You can hack anything you want, with just TECO and DDT.<br>
  $U in and begin to hack.<br>
  Twiddle bits in a core dump and write it back.<br>
  You can hack anything you want, with TECO and DDT.<br>
  (But be careful typing &lt;RET&gt;)<br>
  Just with TECO and DDT!</p>
