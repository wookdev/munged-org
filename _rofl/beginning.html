<p class="words">God created the bit. And the bit was a zero.</p>
<p class="words"> On the first day, he toggled the 0 to 1, and the Universe was. 
  (In those days, bootstrap loaders were simple, and &quot;active low&quot; signals 
  didn't yet exist.)</p>
<p class="words"> On the second day, God's boss wanted a demo, and tried to read 
  the bit. This being volatile memory, the bit reverted to a 0. And the universe 
  wasn't. God learned the importance of backups and memory refresh, and spent 
  the rest of the day (and his first all-nighter) reinstalling the universe.</p>
<p class="words"> On the third day, the bit cried, &quot;Oh, Lord! If you exist, 
  give me a sign!&quot; And God created rev 2.0 of the bit, even better than the 
  original prototype. Those in Universe Marketing immediately realized that &quot;new 
  and improved&quot; wouldn't do justice to such a grand and glorious creation. 
  And so it was dubbed the Most Significant Bit. Many bits followed, but only 
  one was so honored.</p>
<p class="words"> On the fourth day, God created a simple ALU with 'add' and 'logical 
  shift' instructions. And the original bit discovered that -- by performing a 
  single shift instruction -- it could become the Most Significant Bit. And God 
  realized the importance of computer security.</p>
<p class="words"> On the fifth day, God created the first mid-life kicker, rev 
  2.0 of the ALU, with wonderful features, and said, &quot;Forget that add and 
  shift stuff. Go forth and multiply.&quot; And God saw that it was good.</p>
<p class="words"> On the sixth day, God got a bit overconfident, and invented 
  pipelines, register hazards, optimizing compilers, crosstalk, restartable instructions, 
  microinterrupts, race conditions, and propagation delays. Historians have used 
  this to convincingly argue that the sixth day must have been a Monday.</p>
<p class="words"> On the seventh day, an engineering change introduced Windows 
  into the Universe, and a number of key services haven't worked right since.</p>
