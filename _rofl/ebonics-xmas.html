<p class="words"> Twas da night befo' Christmas and all in the hood<br>
  Not a homie was stirring cuz it was all good<br>
  The tube socks was hung on the window sill<br>
  and we all had smiles up on our grill<br>
  Mookie and BeBe was snug in the crib<br>
  in the back bedroom cuz that's how we live<br>
  and moms in her do-rag and me with my nine<br>
  had just gotten busy cuz girlfriend is fine<br>
  All of a sudden a lowrider rolled by<br>
  Bumpin phat beats cuz the system's fly<br>
  I bounced to the window at a quarter pas'<br>
  Bout ready to pop a cap in somebody's #$$!<br>
  well anyway</p>
<p class="words">I yelled to my lady, Yo peep this!<br>
  She said, Stop frontin just mind yo' bidness<br>
  I said, for real doe, come check dis out<br>
  We weren't even buggin, no worries, no doubt<br>
  Cuz bumpin an thumpin' from around da way<br>
  Was Santa, 8 reindeer and a sleigh<br>
  Da beats was kickin, da ride was phat<br>
  I said, Yo red Dawg, you all that!<br>
  He threw up a sign and yelled to his boyz,<br>
  &quot;Ay yo, give it up, let's make some noise!<br>
  To the top of the projects and across the strip mall,<br>
  We gots ta go, I got a booty call!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">He pulled up his ride on the top a da roof<br>
  and sippin on a 40, he busted a move<br>
  I yelled up to Santa, &quot;Yo ain't got no stack!&quot;<br>
  he said, &quot;Damn homie, deese projects is wack!<br>
  But don't worry black, cuz I gots da skillz<br>
  I learnt back when I hadda pay da billz.&quot;<br>
  Out from his bag he pulled 3 small tings<br>
  a credit card, a knife, and a bobby pin.<br>
  he slid down the fire escape smoove as a cat<br>
  and busted the window with a b-ball bat<br>
  I said, &quot;Whassup, Santa? Whydya bust my place?&quot;<br>
  he said,&quot;You best get on up out my face!&quot;<br>
  His threads was all leatha, his chains was all gold<br>
  His sneaks was Puma and they was 5 years old<br>
  He dropped down the duffle, Clippers logo on the side<br>
  Santa broke out da loot and my mouf popped open wide.<br>
  A wink of his eye and a shine off his god toof<br>
  He cabbage patched his way back onto the roof<br>
  He jumped in his hooptie with rims made of chrome<br>
  To tap that booty waitin at home<br>
  and all I heard as he cruised outta sight<br>
  was a loud and hearty.....<br>
  &quot;WEEESST SIIIIDE!!!!!!!&quot; </p>
