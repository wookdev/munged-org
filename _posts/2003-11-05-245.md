I'm not sure why I'm posting this.  I haven't seen the movie yet, even
though its been open for almost a whole 12 hours so far.

Negative reviews abound. Does [Matrix Revolutions](https://www.whatisthematrix.com) suck as
bad as it is reported to?  Were unrealistic expectations set by the first Matrix movie?
Was the first movie a fluke that was REALLY misunderstood, and we've set outselves up
for disappointment?

I will have to see it to figure it out.

No spoilers if you read more, though some of the links do have spoiler info at
the other end of them.  If you don't want to know, don't click on any links.

How bad are the reviews?  A couple of the more thoughtfull reviews:

The Weekly Standard has a review that tears the movie apart.

The [BBC wasn't amused](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3240071.stm "Matrix end is no revelation")
either.  This one is especially damning.
