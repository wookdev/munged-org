Didn't like it.

Who knew Emily Blunt could play such an unlikable character.  Who knew Dwayne
Johnson could be so unbelievable as a steamboat captain.  Who knew Jesse Plemons
could be such an unthreatening villain.  Jack Whitehall did his best as an English
fop, but just couldn't make it work when dropped into the middle of the
rest of the cast.  Who knew Disney could CGI up such an unconvincing jaguar.

The secondary characters were all much better.  Paul Giamati turned in his normal
high-quality performance in his role.  As did Ã‰dgar Ramirez and the rest of the bad guys.
I liked the touch of making (most) of the Spanish conquistadors actually played
by Spanish actors. Nice touch that.

The story and plot were crap.

Look, I realize this is a kids movie.  But that's a bad reason to make a shitty
movie.
