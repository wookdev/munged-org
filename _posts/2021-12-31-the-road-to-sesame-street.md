We watched [The Road To Sesame Street](https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXouLWwp8MsPDIgEAAAqT) on HBO MAX tonight, while waiting for the new year.  It was like reliving our childhoods.

It was well done, and told the story in an engaging way.  They discussed the death of Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper, and even showed the segment they did to talk about death.  This was a landmark thing.

It destroyed both of us.  When it was over, we had to pause the video, and go get drinks.  Catch our breaths.  Blow our noses.  All the while muttering about "those fuckers..."

The death of Jim Henson was covered too, but Sesame Street itself didn't deal with it.

It was good, and we're glad we watched it.
