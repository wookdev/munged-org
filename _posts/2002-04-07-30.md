Rob was over last night. Chinese takeaway on a plate. "Army of Darkness"
on DVD. It was an enjoyable night. I was dying at 10pm due to jet lag. Trying
to stay up tonight until midnight.

I'm syncing all my various sources of contact information. Netscrape and Apple
Mail from the iMac. The stuff in Entourage on The Beast. My pilot. I still need
to get the vCards out of Evolution from the laptop. The goal is to have a single,
sane, contact list to put back into my pilot.

Mike Silvey left RiverSoft this week. E-mailed asking him to keep
in touch. I know that Mike is not the "RiverSoft forever" type, but
I'm still going to miss him.

Need to figure out the OCR stuff for the scanner. Now that the iMac is back
to running OS 9.2.2 exclusively, I gotta plug the scanner back into the iMac
so I can use it.

This link is interesting. The life of an escort agency. Maybe not the most wholesome
of subjects, but I enjoy seeing how people in other kinds of lives get through
their days.

If you were every wondering what makes Google go, have a look at this joke.

Palm has released Palm
Desktop for OS X, finally. I have it installed and working. So, now the
only thing I can't do at all on The Beast is running the scanner. I still have
stuff running in OS X classic, Photoshop, Dreamweaver are the biggies. Photoshop
has been ported to OS X, and I need to pick up the upgrade soon. Still waiting
on Dreamweaver. I should also get Toast, so I can get full use of the Superdrive
in The Beast, but it is working just fine for me on the iMac so far.

Have I said before that the OS 9 user interface is better than the Aqua interface?
It is, in case I haven't.
