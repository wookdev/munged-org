I was way downtown Friday night. Hanging out at a bar I sometimes 
go to down there. When I walked out, I couldn't help but to see the gaping hole 
in the skyline downtown. Work continues around the clock at Ground Zero. At 
night, the place is brilliantly lit by stadium power lighting. It isn't possible 
not to see this.

I've been down there before, and not gone near the place, figuring 
there wouldn't be much to see after dark. "The Platform" a huge ramp 
that offers an elevated view into the hole, is closed at 9 pm. But I was awake, 
and reasonably sober. So I walked down to see what could be seen. I have not 
visited Ground Zero before, for no reason other than I had no real reason to.

The first thing I noticed was the number of assorted other construction/utility 
sites. Ground Zero messed up utilities in that area in a huge way. There are 
holes in the streets and sidewalks for blocks in all directions, many also with 
men in them working around the clock. Cops abound, controlling access to areas 
still deemed too dangerous for non-essential people.

Ground Zero has been worked on enough so far, that it isn't so 
much a pile of rubble any longer, as it is a hole in the ground that could be 
any construction site in the world. Except that this construction site can never 
be just any construction site. At this construction site, what was being excavated 
from the hole was not earth.

I did not have a good view. The site is ringed by a canvas covered 
cyclone fence. Inside the fence are a large amount of mobile trailer offices 
with "GE Capital" signs on them. But there are some breaks in the 
fence where a view can be stolen of the works. Those views were of a hole in
the ground, filled with rubble, with a scoop shovel operating in the middle 
of it. The rubble looks like you've seen on TV. Only individual pieces of it 
are very large, even still.

The scale is exceptional. The WTC took up a huge plot of land. 
It is magnified by all the other building that surround the site. They are all 
tall in their own rights. And the outline they form is very regular. The only 
break in the ring of buildings around a perfectly square city block is where 
7 WTC fell down. All the remaining buildings, on all sides, bare scars. Some
look to have suffered only cosmetic damage, some of which is or has been fixed. 
Some look pretty messed up, with huge, multi-storey, gashes that look deep, 
and terminal.

It is not natural to see a blank spot like this amongst a bunch
of sky-scrapers. No matter how tall a building is (or isn't), it blocks the 
view of things more than a half a block away. But here, there is only this fence, 
and a few construction trailers. The fence does a good job of blocking the hole 
that is now Ground Zero. It doesn't block the buildings across the way.

The remaining buildings stand facing this huge open spot. In
my slightly inebriated state, I couldn't help but to see the wounded looking 
down at the fallen. I can't help but to liken this hole in my city, to the hole 
in the American soul left after 9/11.

I was misty-eyed the whole time I was down there. Thinking thoughts. 
Dealing with it.

It was good to finally go down and see this close up. To see 
the work that has been done, and the amount of it that is going on, even at 
4 AM, is heartening. We will recover. We will rebuild. And while things have 
changed... well... things always do change. The secret, as they used to say 
in westerns, is to get back on the horse.

I think we are well on our way.
