title: Can I Borrow A Cat
---

Today, I was thinking "I should tape bacon to a cat." I know, I know,
[it's been done][bacon taped to cat]. But sometimes, you have to do the things
you have to do.

But I don't own a cat, and Ally won't let me tape bacon to one of hers.

So I guess I'll have to mark today down as a failure.
