Okay,  now I know I've been living in New York City just a <span class="reallyreally">leetle bit</span> to long.  Emergency sirens are a part of life here.  Cops, firetrucks, assorted city functionaries, and ambulances, are all over, and often going somewhere with their sirens blaring.

After a while, you get used to them, and tune them out.

But I know that I've been here to long, and gotten too used to it, because as I was coming home yesterday evening, I walked across the street in front of an ambulance....

An ambulance with it siren going...

An ambulance with a driver that didn't look amused to find me in the middle of his lane.

Sigh.

For what it's worth &mdash; very little, I know &mdash; the light <span class="reallyreally">did</span> say &quot;Walk&quot;.

So I'm wondering what is next, wandering unaware thru a gangland driveby or something equally dumb?  Am I going to get myself killed because I didn't notice that the guy in line in front of me was robbing the place when i tried to sneak in ahead of him?
