RiverSoft, the company I've been working
for these last 3+ years, is over and done. This last week, it was announced
to the world that the board of directors had arranged for the sale of the company
to Micromuse.

To say that I'm bitter about this is an understatement. It is not unexpected
though. The writing was on the wall: the board, along with senior management,
and most of the staff, had lost faith in the prospects of the company long ago.
