title: DemiCon 25 Photos
---

I carried my camera around for a couple of hours at DemiCon. I wasn't very
serious about taking photos. Most of them were shot in insufficient lighting
with the camera in 'P'rogram mode. So most photos were done wide open, and thus
most photos had about 1/8th of an inch depth-of-field, usually focused on the tip of
the nose. There were strange shadows. I was manually focusing, but didn't
care enough to actually focus all the time. People moved.

But a few came out nicely enough to share with the world at large, I think.
I didn't adjust white balance, but I did crop a few quickly.
