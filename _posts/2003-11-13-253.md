[Star Wars: Clone Wars](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/clonewars/index.html "Star Wars: Clone Wars")
has started on the [Cartoon Network](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/ "Cartoon Network").
A bunch of 5 minute shows, it is being called an "epic micro-series".  I think that is my
new, favorite, oxymoron.

And so far, 5 shows in, this thing sucks.

The only reason I'll keep watching it is that the Tivo Guide has it listed,
which I hadn't expected to happen for a 5 minute show.
