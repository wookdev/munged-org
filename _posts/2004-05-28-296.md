A [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/) show called
[Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/)
has a report coming out soon called
[The Way the Music Died](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/ "The Way The Music Died")
which has [an interview with David Crosby](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/interviews/crosby.html)
that describes the problems with the current music industry.  He describes how it came to be, and why
it is wrong.  An incredible interview, really.  Anyone with half a brain already knows all this, but it
is good to see it all said in context, in one place.  Required reading.
