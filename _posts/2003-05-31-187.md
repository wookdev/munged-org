[Terry Bisson](http://www.terrybisson.com) is a Science Fiction writer who has been
around for a while.  Somehow though, I didn't learn of him until this last week.
His web site is pretty standard for an author.  One of the stories on the
site, "They're Made Out Of Meat" is rather screamingly funny.  Check it out.
