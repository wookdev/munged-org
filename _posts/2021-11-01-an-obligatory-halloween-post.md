A day late for actual Halloween, but whatever.

This popped up in my YouTube recommended list today, and I find it a little bit mesmerizing.  Probably because of the stark, bold, colors, and the singers really sell the act.

These guys are a 10-year-old band, with no Wikipedia page.  They're from Vigo, Spain, so maybe just no page in English.  They are a 7-person band, a 3 piece with 4 women singers.  Their covers are hard rock-ish.

A couple of web sites say Broken Peach came to larger notice with their version of "[This is Halloween](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiI6C0142g "Tim Burton - This is Halloween (by Broken Peach)")".  It's a good video.  As is their cover of Abba's "[Mama Mia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TFq7UUWSE "ABBA - Mamma Mia (by Broken Peach)")".

There is a theme here.  The singers are lined up on front, with the guitar, drummer, and bassist behind them.  They do costumes and makeup.  But it's all competently executed, and I've enjoyed watching them.
