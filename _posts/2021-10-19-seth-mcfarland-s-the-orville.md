I've talked about Seth McFarlane's "The Orville" before.  On Twitter maybe.  Or Facebook for that brief time I was back on it.  I thought I posted about it here, but can't find it if I did.

I watched the first two seasons of it... on some streaming service.

IMHO, it is the one true spiritual successor of the [original Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series "Star Trek: The Original Series").  The Orville is far more of what ST:TOS was than any of the successor Star Trek shows.  [Next Gen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "Star Trek: The Next Generation"), [DS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"), [Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager "Star Trek: Voyager"), [Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise "Star Trek: Enterprise"), none of them ever lived up to the original series.

Let's not talk about the idiocy that is [Star Trek: Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery).  "Oh boo hoo, this spore drive thing needs a giant water bear to operate but the water bear gets hurt by it."  Should have been called Star Trek: Trite.  I didn't make it thru the first season, and have no desire to try again.

Anyway, The Orville started as a completely comedy series, but elevated itself into pretty serious speculative fiction pretty quickly.  The season 1 episode "Majority Rule", about an absolute democracy, was dark as hell.

The Orville had two seasons on Fox.  Season three has just been announced:

Can't wait.
