I originally started playing Minecraft back when it was in beta.  I bought it.
It was released 7 months later.  I gave a couple of years of my free time to it before
moving on to other things.

Notch sold Mojang in 2014 to Microsoft.  I continued to play it for a while after that.
I don't remember when I got tired of it.

I'm taking some vacation time from work around xmas and new year day.
While watching some videos I came across [one of my favorite reviews of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgQvij3rVE)
I thought "why not re-install Minecraft and give it a few hours for nostalgia".

That's why.
