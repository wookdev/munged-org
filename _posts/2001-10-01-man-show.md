The Comedy Central
show is an interesting 
idea. An idea that we like. Guys like to see gorgeous women in total states 
of undress bouncing on trampolines. Or those same women dancing on a stage with 
a pole. We cheer for any guy that can drink a beer faster than it can be poured 
on the ground.

We think the time has come for a show where we don't have to
wade through "plot" to catch 5 seconds of left breast. We don't want sensitivity, 
cuteness, or domesticity. We want a show that involves fast cars, fast women, 
guns, nudity, sports, beer, farts, sex, gambling, dogs, and beating each other 
up. Plot is fine, so long as it is worthy of Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. 
This is the shit we like, the show we want.

The problem is: This isn't that show.

Before we really get into this, let us just say that we believe
"The Man Show" does as good a job as 
can be expected ... given its limitations.

The limitations on "The Man
Show" stack up as follows:

* Adam Corolla and Jimmy Kimmel
* Comedy Central's (presumed) censorship
* Real men are never this introspective

For starters, there are Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Corolla. So far,
Jimmy Kimmel's big claim to fame is as sidekick to Ben Stein on "Win Ben Stein's 
Money". We ask you is this a job for a real man? We think not. And Adam Corolla's 
big claim to fame is as Dr. Drew's sidekick on MTV's "Loveline". We think not. 
(We won't delve any deeper into Loveline or Dr. Drew, that is another article.) 
We are looking for retired spots figures with missing teeth, NASCAR drivers, 
astronauts/test pilots, or any other guy who would be banging a different Juggy 
on every commercial break.

Then there is the fact that this show is on Comedy Central. Come
on! This show needs to be on a network that allows nudity and swearing. Do you 
think the Sopranos would have been anywhere near as interesting if the strippers 
in the Bada-Bing club were wearing bras and panties? Short answer: No. Juggy 
Dancers on trampolines would be fun to watch if they weren't wearing bras that 
kept any actual bouncing action from happening. Juggy Dancers on trampolines 
is meaningless if the boobs aren't free to do what we love to see them do. On 
Comedy Central, we have to wonder if the stuff Fox is tossing back by the quart 
is in fact beer.

Finally, this is a show that analyses all the things that real
men like. Real men don't care, or want to know, what we like and why we like 
it. This whole thing comes off like your girlfriend leaving a Cosmopolitan magazine 
on your coffee table in the hopes you'll actually read the section on what turns 
them on in bed. Real guys don't care for any of this, we're just gonna do what 
we like anyway. This show smacks of a show for women about men, thinly veiled 
as a show for men. Adam and Jimmy, the co-creators, are at the heart of this 
problem, being two guys who seems to like to analyze why they like all the things 
they like.

Can "The Man Show" be
saved? Probably not. Is it good enough anyway? Not really. Will we watch if 
it is on and we are bored? Yeah, probably. But while we are watching, bored 
out of our skulls, we will be hoping that two perverts with no necks pitch the 
same idea to HBO.
