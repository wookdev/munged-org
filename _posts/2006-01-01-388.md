I'm in Des Moines this weekend for the annual 3 day new year's eve party.  Formally a party thrown by and for
[DMSFS](http://www.dmsfs.org/ "Des Moines Science Fiction Society"), and called the Semi-Annual
Constitutional Convention.  A bunch of us get together at the Roth Hotel and Convention  Center, and
socialize for a weekend.  This year, the party was from Friday night to Sunday night.  Or maybe Monday
morning.

As usual, I've been taking snapshots.  You can find the snapshots on Flickr.
