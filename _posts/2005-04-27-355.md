I made an order from Amazon recently.  One of the things I got was "The Complete Far Side" collection, by Gary Larson.  Maybe it is appropriate of the Far Side, that I'm trying to figure out what the books are.

You see, this is ALL of the Far Side ever printed, and some that weren't ever printed.  It comes as two volumes.  The books are HUGE, and weigh a ton.

They might be coffee table books, but I'd be afraid to put them on my coffee table for fear it would collapse.  I should probably use them AS a coffee table.  And I had intended to read them in bed before going to sleep.  But I need a bigger bed.

I'm not even sure if I have a bookshelf that can handle these monsters.

Still, they are damn cool.  The foward is by Steve Martin, and was even sorta funny.  They are nicely done books, even if porky, but on the other hand, there are a lot of Far Sides.  It ran for 14 years, which is long enough to fit in just two volumes, if they are the weight of boat anchors.

So if you don't hear from me soon, send a search party. I've probably dropped one of these on myself.
