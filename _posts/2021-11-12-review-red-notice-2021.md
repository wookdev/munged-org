Not a good movie.

I wanted to like it.  Who doesn't like Ryan Renolds, Dwayne Johnson, and Gal Gadot?  But I couldn't.

For starters, the CGI looked startlingly fake.  I mean, this was supposedly the most expensive movie that Netflix has picked up at $200 Million.  But this is a legitimate "where did they spend that money?" movie.  If they actually did spend the money on CGI, they got ripped off.

The story is lame.  It didn't have to be.  But it is.  All the story beats where telegraphed way ahead of time, and the leads did not work very hard to sell any of their parts.

It was just kind of a mediocre plod, all the way thru.
