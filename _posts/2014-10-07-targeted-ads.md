Check out this piece: [Why Do Contextual Ads Fail?][]

My first thought at looking at the title of this, was "who's still browsing
the internet without an ad-blocker?" (Ad blocking software is another topic
for another article here. Someday I'll write it.)

I've always wondered why ads supposedly targeted at my interests and needs
never try to sell me something I'm interested in or need.

Based on my
experience using Facebook without ad blocking software for a while, I have
to assume they think every single guy in existence needs a membership to a
dating site. I didn't at the time. Those ads went away instantly when I
removed my relationship status.

The best story I heard about targeted ads was when Bobcat Goldthwait said on
NPR's, "[Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me][]":

> I was writing a script that had a lot of guns in it and I spent a lot of
> time looking at guns online. And eventually, I'm not kidding, ads for Arkansas
> came up.

This is either the biggest fail I know of, or somehow the biggest success.
I can't decide which.

Back to the article tho, one thing that caught my attention was the following:

> "You're the product." I'll admit that I've used that line myself. But I've

> With contextual advertising, you're not the product. Advertisers don't own you.

I don't buy the idea that we're not the product social networks sell. They
aren't selling information they have on us, they are selling access. Just
because my info is anonymous, doesn't mean the social network could exist
without that info. Which still makes us the product.
