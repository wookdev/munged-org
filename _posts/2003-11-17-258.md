I was looking at the referral logs for munged.org tonight.  The search keywords that bring people to my site are one of the things I can see.

For November, the number 1 search term that brings people to my site is "checked".

Number 2, however, makes me wonder just a little.  Number 2 search term is "kids having sex"[^1].

Okay, this makes me more than just wonder.  Not sure what, if anything I can do about it though.

I have an idea what you can do -- write more about squirrels having sex with melons.  (I guarantee "squirrels having sex with melons" will make the referral log next month!)

[^1]: 2022 Update: Turns out the site had been hacked to serve porn out of directories that were
      part of the Movable Type software itself.  It was never visible by following links on
      my site, but Google could be made to index disconnected pages like this via a couple
      of tricks.  I finally put in a cron job that deleted the directory every hour, since it
      was always the same one.

      I don't think the porn was of children.  I stopped looking at it after a while.
