One of the challenges during my time as an sales engineer ("SE", though SMARTS calls them "system engineer") for SMARTS has been describing to people what it is that I do.  I'm part of a sales department, and talk to customers directly, but I'm not a sales person.  I think I've done a good job of describing what I did such that people understood, but it is hard.

Well, now I won't have this problem.

As of the beginning of this year I now work in Profesional Services ("proserv" or sometimes just "ps") in SMARTS.  Proserv is in-house consultants that install our software after the sale.

This is a good thing, I think, and I asked for the move.  I think that being in proserv is more in line with my temperment than being an SE was.  This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy my time as an SE.  The SMARTS sales organization is amazing, and I found it very easy to work in this rather demanding environment.

So I'm looking forward to being more technical.  It also amounts to a change of pace that I'm looking forward to.  Even though I'll be back on the road a lot more.

The joke that I enjoy, is that in moving from sales to proserv, I've moved from BS to PS.
