title: Site Migration 2022 Version
---

I've posted before about being [all in on Cloudflare]({% post_url 2021-10-07-all-in-on-cloudflare %}).

Today I "cut over" to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), getting off
of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). There's nothing wrong
with Github Pages, I just wanted to try this new thing.  I'm still building it with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). But now I have to configure [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
[gems](https://rubygems.org) as part of the site.

The [old site](http://wookdev.github.io/) used a slightly modified version of Jekyll's default
[Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). New site uses a hacked-up
version of the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

Dark themes have become a thing because screens are getting
so bright now, that a big, pure-white, web page is eye-searing.
The old site was a "light" theme.  The new site uses dark version of the
[Solarized theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).  This theme may
have more color science behind it than any other.  I've gone with a dark version
of the theme, with the sliding menu using the complimentary light version.
I may switch the whole site to the lighter version, or figure out how
to allow users to choose.  This one needs time.

Switched to using system fonts. This was fascinating to me.  There is a fairly
serious amount of typographic work that goes into making operating systems
look good in a brand-forward way.  Using the results of that work is not a
bad plan.  This site will look a little different on different browsers,
because there's no way
on macOS to directly use Apple's new system font "San Fransisco".
There is a new-ish standard for a way to access system fonts in browsers, but
support is still being worked out.

The site has commenting now.  The Movable Type and WordPress versions used to
allow commenting, and there it was used.  So I've got it again.  Sadly, nobody
knows this site exists any more.  Probably won't be a hugely used feature.
Commenting requires a login on Github to enable.  Those rare people that do
find this site might find this to be another hurdle commenting.  But past
versions of the site did have comments, and it was good.

I've collected some things that were on previous versions
of the site, but haven't been recently, and will restore them.
Humor archives and some stuff I find entertaining.

There are, as well as I can recall, 5 previous versions of munged.org:

1. Site coded by hand, and then Dreamweaver. Served by a shared hosting system
   
   2001 - 2002:  These pages still exist, and I keep them around as a curiosity. They
   come from my days at RiverSoft, when I travelled for a living and
   sometimes committed information technology work.

2. Movable Type, served by that same shared hosting system

   2003 - 2009: Also still mostly exist, and forms most of the content on this site.
   Did a lot of blogging during this time.  Experienced a lot and wrote
   about much of it.

3. Written in WordPress, served by that same shared hosting system

   2009 - 2014: Lost.  Nothing wrong with WordPress, per se, but the site
   was hacked to serve porn pretty frequently, and I didn't want to deal with
   keeping up with it.

5. [Migrated to SquareSpace]({% post_url 2014-04-21-first-post %})

   2014 - 2015: SquareSpace is a fantastic site
   if you're trying to sell something.  Complete shit for a non-photographic
   blog like this one.

6. [Migrated to Github Pages]({% post_url 2015-04-22-github-pages %})

   2015 - yesterday: This was easy, and I was getting into git and Github.
   This seemed like a way to learn both by way of Jekyll and static site
   generation.

7. Now, migrated to Cloudflare Pages.

We shall see how this works out.  Coding the site has been fun, and that work
continues as I enhance it and import the old content.  I've written
some things recently.  Might do more.
