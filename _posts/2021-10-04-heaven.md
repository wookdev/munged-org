> “I don’t like the term heaven. It implies we can’t make this earth, this present, into a wonderful place. That humans only deserve it after death—and only if we follow some predetermined set of rules. I think the act of striving for an idea instead of living it is ridiculous.”

Excerpt From: “Reset.” by Sarina Dahlan
