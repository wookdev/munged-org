EverQuest II, the next generation of a game commonly called "EverCrack" for its ability to pull
people in so completely they loose touch with the outside world, is starting to enter that area
where I'd call them "a dealer".

This is for real, it would seem.

In EverQuest, many commands are activated by typing the command after a slash.  Thus the
command "/who" will show you information about all the people near you.  Sony Online
Entertainment ("SOE") has added a /pizza command that will launch a web browser directly
to Pizza Hut's order page.

Just for the record, I do not play EverQuest II.
