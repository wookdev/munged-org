Yeah, so [Nonpoint's](https://nonpoint.com "NONPOINT") cover of [Prince's](https://prince.com "Prince") "[When Doves Cry](https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-doves-cry-radio-edit/1582770910?i=1582770913)" is a nice effort, and is an instance of thinking outside that box I have to applaud.  This is right up there with Disturbed doing "[The Sound of Silence](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-sound-of-silence/1006937448?i=1006937459)", which is genius and worked oh so well.

I think there are definitely bands that could make really interesting covers of this song.

Nonpoint's version just didn't do it for me tho.  I want to like it, I just can't.
