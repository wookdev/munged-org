Got a COVID booster shot today.  My doctor was so worried that I get one that she gave me a prescription for a Moderna shot.  Sadly, I didn't get around to using it before everyone was just generally eligible.  That I had a prescription still makes me smile.

"Are you eligible for a booster?"

"Doesn't matter, I have a prescription!"

I got the original two Moderna shots on a Thursday.  That night, and all day Friday my arm was really sore around the injection site.  Then Saturday and Sunday I was so fatigued I could hardly get out of bed.  I was back to normal on Monday again.

This time, it's Friday.  So far, nothing at all, but it's still early.  We shall see.

Saturday Update: My arm hurts.
