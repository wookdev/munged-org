Running for the airport, but just wanted to get this up before I forget about
it.

My niece, Nikki, had her first hot date this last weekend, I hear. She will
soon be 17. I asked my brother if he had the requisite room full of guns or
martial arts trophies ready to impress the lucky boy. I thought his response
was good:

> I gave her two pieces of advice.
> 1. For first dates, a movie and coffee is a big commitment. There needs
>   to be a plan for a quick out, which as it turns out, she used after the
>   movie.
> 2. Tell him I own a gun.
