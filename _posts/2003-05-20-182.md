Some times I go to sites where I can register internet domain names, and just
plug assorted words in to see if they are registered, and/or available.
My favorite tool for this is DomainSurfer.

But I just stumbled onto a site
that comes at this from the other direction.  Using a
list of common words hosted
on SourceForge, this guy does a
lookup on domains in use, and makes a list of the dictionary words on the
list that aren't yet domains.

Some of my favorites:

scrota.com<br />
veined.com<br />
abjurer.com<br />
cloacae.com<br />
foul-up.com<br />
leprous.com<br />
no-show.com<br />
octette.com<br />
off-key.com<br />
stabber.com<br />
tacitly.com<br />
abnegate.com<br />

Even the short list - the one for the dot com left-overs - is pretty large.
there are even a couple of (mostly lame) web site ideas kicking around on this list.
