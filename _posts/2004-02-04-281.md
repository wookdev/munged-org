I had to go to Harborside, in New Jersey today.  The last couple of times I've gone over there,
I've taken the ferry across, because it stops literally right next to the building.  Today though,
I met up with Mike, the sales guy, at Herald Square, and we took the [PATH](http://www.panynj.gov/path/)
train out of the World Trade Center.

For those that don't know, the PATH is one of the <acronym title="The third NYC subway is the SIRT
on Staten Island">"other two"</acronym> subways in NYC.  PATH stands for "Port Authority Trans Hudson",
and is run by the Port Authority.  PATH goes under the Hudson River, over to some destinations in New
Jersey.  It is a vital transportation link, even though Real New Yorkers have little use for it. 

Still, it was nice to see the new interim WTC station.  It very much looks temporary, being just
a steel structure with cement floors.  But the ceilings are high, and the platforms are wide.
It is about as pleasant as you could expect.  Maybe a little more so.
