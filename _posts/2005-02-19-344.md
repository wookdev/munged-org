My friend Anne proclaimed my a
"[Vulgarian](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulgarian "Merriam Webster definition of Vulgarian")"
the other night.  Apparently this is a term fresh out of
"[A Fish Called Wanda](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/ "A Fish Called Wanda Movie").
It has been a while, and it is a good movie, so I'm going to have to watch it to check.

She meant it in the best possible way, which is how I took it.
