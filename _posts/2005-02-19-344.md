My friend Anne proclaimed my a "<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=vulgarian&x=0&y=0" title="Vulgarian">Vulgarian</a>" the other night.  Apparently this is a term fresh out of "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/" title="A Fish Called Wanda">A Fish Called Wanda</a>".  It has been a while, and it is a good movie, so I'm going to have to watch it to check.

She meant it in the best possible way, which is how I took it.
