I enjoyed it immensely.

I really liked the ornithopters.  I really liked Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho.  I really liked the production design.  I really liked the sound design.

I've been an Oscar Isaac fan ever since I saw him in Sucker Punch.  I thought his beard in this role looked really fake.

Rebecca Ferguson has an austere beauty that worked well for her role, and she's certainly capable.  But there were a couple of times where I thought she was more Paul's sister than mother.

Finally, I liked how faithful to the book they were in translating it to the screen and the way they were faithful.  The things they decided to bring across from the book to the screen were "minimum viable movie".
