Prozak for Lovers is a band, or act maybe, so named because you'll need
some to stop laughing at this CD.

The tracking goes as follows:

1. Proud Mary
2. Pump It Up
3. Aqualung
4. Love Will Tear Up Apart
5. (Don't Fear) The Reaper
6. Message of Love
7. I Wanna Be Sedated
8. London Calling
9. Rebel Rebel
10. Rolsom Prison Blues

I hear you asking: "So? Lots of people have covered these tunes."

Yes, but most don't do them as sleepy lounge numbers.  I'm listening to
the preview tracks right now.  I think I peed my pants laughing somewhere
during "I Wanna Be Sedated".
