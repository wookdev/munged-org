Very soon, munged.org will be moving from the current hosting provider to
[Liquid Web](http://www.liquidweb.com/ "Liquid Web Inc.")[^1].  I wasn't going to
post anything about this event, until it was a done deal.

But I signed up this morning, and 10 minutes later, they called to verify
that I actually placed an order.  So far, they gets points for being prompt,
and doing the work on a weekend morning.  But they don't get raves or
anything for that.

What they DO get raves for is that the guy that called me actually **pronounced my last name correctly**.
And he wasn't stuttering like he wasn't sure if that was the correct way to pronounce it either.

**This NEVER happens.**

I've hardly gotten signed up, and already I'm feeling pretty welcome in the state of Michigan.

[^1]: 2022 Update: Appears they still exist too, 19 years later.
