I'm in St. Louis this week.  I flew down Monday afternoon, thru Chicago, on United.
This is just notable because American Airlines practically owns Lambert Field.
They got it when they purchased TWA.

I'd forgotten that this city isn't a favorite of mine.

To state the positive, the downtown Hilton hotel is all of 2 weeks old at this point.
It is a nice hotel, though my room was rather seriously on the small side.  After the first
night, I moved to the Omni Majestic hotel, which is a smaller hotel, and a little older, but
has been decent so far.  My room was again, rather small, but other's rooms were larger than mine.

In this, it has been a much better trip than any of my previous ones.  The only time
I really enjoyed myself on any previous trip, I visited my friends Mark and Steph in
Rolla, MO, which is an hour outside St. Louis.

Why is St. Louis still not a place I would choose to go to?  I haven't run across anything
so far to bring me back.  I'm downtown, and there is very little to do down here.  It is a
clasic "roll up the sidewalks at 6pm kind of thing.  There might be intesting stuff to do
here, but I haven't seen any of it.  Hell, my father and a bunch of friends think St. Louis
is lots of fun.

I wish I could see that St. Louis.  Mostly what I see is just no big deal.
