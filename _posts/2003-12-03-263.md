I said I was [getting a new kitchen]({% post_url 2003-11-14-256 %}).
Well, I am getting a new kitchen.  I'm getting capet in all the other rooms.
I'm getting another bathroom, which I was going to dedicate to the litterbox
for a new cat, until I realized that some good friends wouldn't be able to
visit me due to cat alergies.

Yes, I'm moving.

I'm not going far, just upstairs to an appartment on the fourth floor.
That apartment is a 6 room, 3 bedroom, 2 bath, apartment.  It has a dining room.  Not that
I'd know what to do with a dining room, but I'll have one should I ever figure it out.
Maybe I'll use the dining room as a photo studio.

The Move happens when it is ready, which it isn't quite yet.  Probably this weekend, after
the carpet and cabinets are done. But, we shall see.
