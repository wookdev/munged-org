While going over the site I'm re-reading things I wrote long ago.
[This one]({% post_url 2003-03-26-137 %}) caught my eye.

One of the things I said:

I mellowed on Dubya after I wrote this.  Yes, I was angry about his
shortcomings.  I still am to some extent.  But as the books came out
after he and his administration left office, I found some measure of
respect for him.  That was during the Obama administration.

Now that we've had a traitor in word and deed
in the oval office, well, Dubya doesn't stack up so bad.  My view of
Dubya these days is he was a conservative guy, surrounded by even more
conservative elements with agendas.

There still no way I'd vote for him.  But I'd shake his hand if I
met him.
