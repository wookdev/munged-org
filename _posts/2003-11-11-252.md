Linked today on Slashdot, "The 10 most overpaid jobs in the U.S." on CBS Marketwatch,
details the 10 most overpaid professions in the U.S. today.  A lot of the 10 are what
you'd expect: CEOs, mutual fund managers, pilots, longshoremen, high-end real estate
agents.  There are a couple of surprises: airport skycaps being one.

The one I thought was interesting was "Wedding Photographer".  Most get an
astonishing amount of money, can do two weddings a weekend, and are mostly
mediocre.  So I guess my photography habit could be profitable after all,
if I am willing to deal with shrieking mother-in-laws-to-be, and high-strung
brides and grooms.

I think I'll pass on this opportunity, for now.
