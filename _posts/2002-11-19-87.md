Does anybody else see the incredible irony of spammers selling anti-spam software?
Do you think any software from a spammer works?

I was going thru an old folder of two-year old mail. I'm going to have to put
some of it up in IIRC, since much of it is in this same kind of style. So it
is possible that this journal will grow backwards in time, as well as the more
normal direction. Beware.

I saw a funny description of Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota today in a travel
article on [photo.net](http://www.photo.net/):

> Divided by the Mississippi River and united by the belief that the
> inhabitants of the other side of the river are inferior.&quot; 

They had generally good things to say about the Twin Cities.

Ran across some [good dog quotes]({% link rofl/dogs.md %}) in some old,
buried folders in my mail store. Up in [ROFL]({% link rofl.md %}).
