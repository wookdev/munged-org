Hmmm.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) has [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/ "Cloudflare Pages").  Much like [Github](https://github.com "Github") has [Pages](https://pages.github.com "Github Pages").

Cloudflare pages load out of git repositories.  I'd still need Github for the git repo.  But Cloudflare reads the repo and does the build and caches it.  It wouldn't be Github doing the serving of the actual pages to be cached by Cloudflare.

Worth thinking about.
