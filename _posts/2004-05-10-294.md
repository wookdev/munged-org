The problem with using Freshdirect, is one of garbage.  Or rather, getting rid of garbage.

It is the little things that annoy you, ya know?

I used to go to C-Town, the crappy grocery store across the street, a couple times a week.  I'd come home with a couple of bags of stuff.  The stuff would go in the fridge or whatever.  That bags, eventually, would go in the waste basket, to be used as a trash liner.

This was an ideal situation, because the garbage chute in this building isn't very large.  Anything much larger than a plastic grocery bag, is to big to fit easily into the chute.  Also, I always had more bags than I could use, so those occational fits of housekeeping would use up the extras.

Well, today I'm cleaning a little so that I can clear some space.  New airconditioners will be installed tomorrow, and I need to clear space to move the stereo around in the living room, and I'm probably going to have to out-right change where the computer desk is in the office so the air conditioner isn't blowing right on me when I'm working.

And, I'm almost out of plastic grocery bags.  Freshdirect delivers in boxes, which are easier to manage on a truck, and to carry on hand carts for delivery.

Now, I have to remember to buy trash bags.
