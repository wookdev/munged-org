Wook (that's me) was 40 on this day.  I'm in Las Vegas right now, in the Monte Carlo hotel on the Vegas Strip.  So far, I've gambled, seen shows, oggled strippers, and generally had a great time hanging with the crowd.

More after I get home.

The acronym <b>tRIP</b> stands for "the Rest In Peace"

On this date, I will be 40.  And on this date, I will be celebrating in Las Vegas.  You are all invited.

So far, the plans are this: I will be having Thanksgiving with my friends Dave and Haley.  That night, after turkey, we will fly to Vegas.  We will then spend the weekend having fun, and celebrating my almost being "over the hill".  I won't be doing a formal party or anything, but we will be seeing shows, having fabulous meals, and generally trying to get into all the right trouble.

The plans are that the weekend will be over on Monday, which is actually the day of my birthday.   Most people will be going home that day.  I will be staying in Vegas until Tuesday.  Then I will spend the rest of the next two weeks visiting other parts of the Desert Southwest.  Those plans are still in progress.

If you wish to join us, send me email letting me know.  People are welcome to join just for the 3 or 4 days in Las Vegas, or to hang out for all or part of the two weeks after too.
