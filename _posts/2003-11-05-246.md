While poking around for the [Matrix Revolutions story]({% post_url 2003-11-05-245 %}),
I ran across this article on the BBC News site:
[Titanic Sinks In Worst Film Poll](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3242607.stm "Titanic Sinks In Worst Film Poll").
A poll has named Titanic, the biggest box office hit to date and winner of 11 Oscars, the worst film ever.

Favorite quote:

> "It sank. There. I've saved you three hours of your life."

I couldn't agree more, though I might not put in in the top 10.  Much as I hated it,
there are plenty of worse films out there.
