Liked it, but didn't love it.  I found it to be okay.

I can see where people might dislike or even hate it.  It's a weird picture like that, I think.  I found I had the patience for it, but not everyone will.

I don't know of any open questions that needed to be answered after the original "The Matrix" trilogy.  This movie doesn't try to answer any, which is a plus in its favor.  I think this got made because Lana Wachowski came up with it all and felt it needed to be made.  I can see that, and agree.  Once this idea was a script, that script needed to be made.  I'm glad it was made.

The Matrix trilogy suffers from being deeply philosophical.  The first movie asked so many questions, we had an immense amount of fun working out answers for them.  Do a search for the "philosophy of the matrix", and you'll find tons of stuff.  There are college classes and all sorts of things.  It starts out as an enormous cloud of possibility.  As the sequels start collapsing the possibilities into a single quantum state, it was never going to be as good as it could have been, no matter where it ended up.  This was a series of movies that just can't win after the first one was made.

It started really slow.  I spent the first 20 minutes or so reminding myself that I wanted to see this movie.  Once they were done setting the scene and establishing everyone's motives, it was okay.  It would have been better if they'd managed to make me give a shit about any of the characters during that time.  But once it got moving it was interesting enough that I forgot I didn't give a shit about any of those characters.

Neil Patrick Harris was incredible.  He radiated pure menace.  Stole every scene he was in.  I hope it's possible for him to get some supporting role nominations for his work here.  But he's the only nomination-worthy thing in this picture, so probably won't happen.

The idea that Neo and Trinity could power a whole matrix by themselves doesn't jibe for me. I don't understand how removing Neo and Trinity from the matrix jeopardizes Io, which seems have nothing to do with it.

Getting in and out of the matrix was a whole thing, every time, in the original trilogy.  It wasn't a trivial thing, requiring being at "broadcast depth", and a "hard line". Every time.  I liked that this used mirrors to get in and out, but didn't like that they played fast and loose with that.  They have to find a mirror on the train to get out of the matrix one time, but the next they're in a bombed out structure in the matrix fighting, then they're back on the ship again.  I found myself out of the story wondering where the intact mirror was in that bombed out building.

I really liked Jonathan Groff as a new Smith, tho I kept trying to figure out why the machines hadn't purged Smith outright after he was defeated.

I am okay with where it ended.  I didn't like it got there.  I spent the whole time waiting for an arc where Neo relearns/regains his powers.  I guess there was one, of sorts, but I really didn't buy it.  Trinity couldn't fly in the original trilogy, why can she now?  Yes, she was supposedly part of the original anomaly.  But that's a really clumsy retcon.

The Matrix Resurrections is a good movie, and was well made.  Its only real crime was that it could have been better.
