I was asked to be the Fan GoH for [DemiCon 18](http://www.demicon.org/18/), this weekend.
DemiCon 18 would be in 2007, so there is yet time for [DMSFS](http://www.dmsfs.org)
(DemiCon's organizers) to come to their senses.

I'm still very honored that they would think me worthy.  I'd like to thank them for making my year.

That year being 2007, or course.
