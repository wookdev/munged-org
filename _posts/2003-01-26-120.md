Here's the promised &quot;news on the job front&quot;.

Tomorrow, I start work with Systems
Management Arts, sometimes called SMARTS[^1].
The &quot;home office&quot; is in White Plains, New York. This is in Westchester
county, the first county north of New York city. I haven't completely got the
commute thing figured out yet, but it is a reverse commute that seems to be
about 40 minutes by Metro North commuter train.

You can follow the ongoing tale, as always, in the journal.

[^1]: SMARTS got themselves acquired by EMC, the storage company. I'm not
      exactly sure when. Then Dell bought EMC, which is where the SMARTS
      domain name redirects now.
