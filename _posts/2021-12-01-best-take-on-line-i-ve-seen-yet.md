From ["Ubuntu Annoyances"](https://geoff.greer.fm/2010/04/30/ubuntu-annoyances/) by [Geoff Greer](https://geoff.greer.fm/) 30 Apr 2010.

Admittedly, this post is over 10 years out of date now.

You have to have lived thru the age when the
[Yugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo), "the worse car in history",
and [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia), where it
was made, were both still things.

I did live thru those times, and I find this quote funny.
I find the state of desktop Linux to be unchanged even a
little bit since 2010.
