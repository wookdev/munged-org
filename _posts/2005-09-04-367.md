I'm a <a href="http://www.venganza.org/" title="Open Letter">Pastafarian</a>.

Another decent source of information is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, which has collected a bunch of information about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a>.

Why FSM is right for me (from the web site):
<ul>
<li>Flimsy moral standards.</li>
<li>Every friday is a relgious holiday. If your work/school objects to that, demand your religious beliefs are respected and threaten to call the ACLU.</li>
<li>Our heaven is WAY better. We've got a Stripper Factory AND a Beer Volcano.</li>
</ul>

Okay, so this isn't why I'm joining.  I'm joining because I have been touched by his noodly appendage, and now, the world and all the people in it, make sense.
