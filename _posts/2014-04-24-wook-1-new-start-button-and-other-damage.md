title: Start Button and Other Damage

![startbutton][]

Car goes in next week for a new "Start Engine Stop" button. The foil is peeling off, and
it is a warranty fix, so I'm gonna let them fix it before the car is out of warranty
next month.

More serious tho, is the rattle under the car. They found it is a heavy steal
cross-member that is bent, and contacting the exhaust pipe. They said you'd have
to hit a pretty big rock or something with the full weight of the car to bend this
thing. It is part of the bracing for torsional rigidity, and is heavy enough that
they had no way to bend it back. It needs to be replaced.

That's not warranty work, and is probably a 7- or $800 fix. Now to decide if that's
far enough above the $500 deductible that it is worth doing as an insurance thing.
I'm curious what a body shop would say about it tho. Maybe they have a big jig of
some sort that they can just bend it back for cheap. If it does end up being an
insurance thing, might be time to get the second set of deer dents taken care of,
too.
