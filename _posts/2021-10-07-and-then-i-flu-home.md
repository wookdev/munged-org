Got my flu shot on Monday.

Up until now, I mostly didn't get it, because I didn't think I needed it.  I was "young" for certain values of young, and figured I wasn't in danger.

I'm getting older.  Every year I'm more and more in the crosshairs of people that can get sick enough to die from the flu.  There is no age at which it goes entirely from "won't die if you do catch the flue" to "you will totally die if you catch the flu".  It creeps up on you.  It would suck to have lived thru These Times, and then die of the flu just when things were turning around again.
