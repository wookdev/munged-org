title: The Month After Christmas
---
 
'Twas the month after Christmas,<br>
and all through the house<br>
Nothing would fit me,<br>
not even a blouse.<br>
The cookies I'd nibbled,<br>
the eggnog I'd taste<br>
At the holiday parties<br>
had gone to my waist.<br>
When I got on the scales<br>
there arose such a number!<br>
When I walked to the store<br>
(less a walk than a lumber).<br>
I'd remember the marvelous<br>
meals I'd prepared;<br>
The gravies and sauces and<br>
beef nicely rared,<br>
The wine and the rum balls,<br>
the bread and the cheese<br>
And the way I'd never said,<br>
"No thank you, please."<br>
As I dressed myself in my<br>
husband's old shirt<br>
And prepared once again<br>
to do battle with dirt---<br>
I said to myself, as I only can<br>
"You can't spend a winter<br/>
disguised as a man!"<br>
So--away with the last of<br>
the sour cream dip,<br>
Get rid of the fruit cake,<br>
every cracker and chip<br>
Every last bit of food<br>
that I like must be banished<br>
"Till all the additional<br>
ounces have vanished.<br>
I won't have a cookie--not even a lick.<br>
I'll want only to chew<br>
on a long celery stick.<br>
I won't have hot biscuits,<br>
or corn bread, or pie,<br>
I'll munch on a carrot<br>
and quietly cry.<br>
I'm hungry, I'm lonesome,<br>
and life is a bore---<br>
But isn't that what January is for?<br>
Unable to giggle,<br>
no longer a riot.<br>
Happy New Year to all<br>
and to all a good diet!
