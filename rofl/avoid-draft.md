title: The TEN Ways to Avoid the DRAFT
---


Hey, you. Yeah... YOU! Pacifist type. Are you thinking "Hey,
this isn't MY war." Or maybe you think, "Fifty cents more at the pump
is worth my life! Heck, even sixty cents!" Perhaps you've weighed
the issues, "Solar Energy... Death in the Sand... Hmmm... Solar
Energy.... Death in the Sand..." Maybe you're all set, and you're
ready to fight. BUT, should you decide that War is "not your thing",
it could help you to know... 

### The TEN Ways to Avoid the DRAFT

1. Self-Exile (The Canadian Maneuver)

 A popular choice during Vietnam. A classic. This is a good opportunity 
 to "see the world." Actually, it's like being drafted in that you 
 get to learn new customs in a different culture, (saying "eh" to indicate 
 that you are speaking, beer drinking as an artform, finding out what a "took" 
 (rhymes with "Luke") is and why you wear it on you head). Plus, there 
 is always the comforting knowledge aht there will always be a room (10x10x8) 
 waiting for you back in the States.

2. Physical Phake (The Springsteen Gambit or No-Doze about it)

 This is fairly easy. Simply watch 72 hours of TV straight. The 
 VCR is ok, and so are video games, but theater movies are out. The key is the 
 cathode-ray tube. Be sure to sit close to the set. Feel free to eat if you must, 
 and bathroom breaks are OK, but no sleep! Caffeine is totally legal. This must 
 be done immediately prior to your physical examination for the Armed Forces. 
 Try not to yawn when you get there, but don't resist your urge to make guttural 
 moans. The only disadvantage is that coming off the caffeine buzz is liable 
 to drop you into a coma, but think of all the rock songs you can write.

3. Physical for Real (Mono on Mono or "Hello, kiss me... what's your name?")

 Going without sleep has no effect on you? You've got the all-nighter's 
 tolerance? You're going to need to catch something. Virulent. This can definitely 
 involve some interesting social interactions.

4. Ageification (The Doctor Method...who?)

 Age yourself seven or so years in a hurry! This stratagem either 
 requires some very expensive time travel equipment or your girlfriend telling 
 you she accidentally took the Pill out of order and has been eating vitamins for 
 the past week. In any case, an old British phone booth can be substituted for 
 one of these methods.

5. Dopeification (Whajjuu say, man?)

 The trick is to balance you inner inner cerebral whirl on the 
 brink of the utmost ultimate hazy high while downing a fifth ducking to avoid 
 that mind-worm and trying to find that mushroom or other tab of the really fucked 
 up stuff and your third eye is screammmming and your head is hammmmering... 
 and when you wake up in de-tox, the whole thing is over. Ten years ago.

6. Conscientious Objection (The "peace and non-violence, brother" strategy)

 Just file for exemption as a conscientious objector. Note, you 
 must prove (with notarized documents) that you've been an objector since age 
 three, have a visible aura, and stigmata.

7. Captivity (Non-self anti-exile)

 The default method. See, the draft is a choice. If you make 
 NO choice at all, and just go about your life as usual, you will NOT be drafted! 
 When you don't report to base after receiving your draft notice, the army won't 
 make you fight. In fact, they'll take you to a maximum security penal institution 
 for a nice long visit. (Bonus: free food, shelter, and back rubs).

8. Orientation Rearranging ("Sir, you are one HOT sergeant, sir!")

 Under the sexual orientation heading of your draft acknowledgement 
 form, check the box next to "homosexual." You couldn't beg them to 
 let you stay in.

9. In and Out (The Max Klinger Section 8 Clause)

 Sure! You'll fight! Report in. Move in to the barracks! You 
 want to fight, yeah. Act enthused... maybe... too enthused. Talk about how you 
 dreamed of this to your bunkmate. Be sure to keep a hollow, far away look in 
 your eyes. It's also a good idea to twitch random muscles whenever anyone is 
 near you. Scream "DIE" very loudly several times during the night. 
 In the morning, say Sergeant, Satan told me he loves me and is glad I'm 
 here." Repeat as necessary, don't blink, and drool slightly from one corner 
 of your mouth. Once you get to the sanitarium, cheerily convince the doctors 
 you were just kidding and that you are actually quite sane.

10. Violence (The Last Resort)

  While attending a student's birthday party during a later week 
  of one of his hunger strikes, Ghandi was offered a piece of chocolate cake by 
  a less enlightened disciple. The disciple then remembered Ghandi's fast and 
  repealed the offer, apologizing. The doctors managed to sew the man's nose back 
  to his face, but Ghandi's lesson to him is well noted. Should you find your 
  back to the wall, here are some recommended guidelines in the use of violence: 
  cause pain, be random, no mercy, hit, yell, kick, cheat, avoid soft things, 
  steroids can help but watch out for liver damage down the road, pinching hurts 
  a lot but doesn't do a lot of damage, be senseless, dominate, dominate, dominate, 
  don't let him get away with that, take the safety off, and there are NO innocents! 
  Sure, you may become the thing you most despise, but at least it's your fight.

Good Luck!

And remember, if things don't work out... don't forget the flea powder.
