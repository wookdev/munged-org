title: SIGNIFICANT OTHERS SPEAK OUT!!!
---

By: Shirley Clawson 

So you've found yourself attracted to a computer nerd. (Sorry 
techies; that IS what those of us that exist in the real world call you.) Spousal 
units and significant others (collectively referred to herein as "SO's") 
who have long endured the idiosyncrasies of their techie mates have banded together 
to provide the unsuspecting "future significant other" a peek at existence 
with: THE TECHIE. But first, a couple of disclaimers: All persons and events 
portrayed in this article are real and any resemblance to actual people or incidents 
is entirely intentional. Techies portrayed herein are of the male variety but 
male SO's have confirmed that they experience the same phenomenon in relation 
to their female techies. 

To properly co-exist with a techie, you must first understand 
three basic premises on which his view of the world is based:

1. There is a proper order in the universe. Computers come first; 
significant others somewhere thereafter.

2. Programmers, while reluctantly admitting (subsequent to intense 
pressure) that they are not God, are however, equal to God.

3. Computer illiterate people are complete morons.

These three premises result in techies having a drastically 
different way of thinking as compared to the average person. This unique approach 
to life will be exhibited on a daily basis in many subtle ways:

It is true that techies rarely subscribe to GQ magazine but, in all 
fairness, let's dispense with the slide-rule, taped glasses, white, 
button-down shirt stereotype. They no longer wear slide-rules; 
laptops are in. Taped glasses -- well, ok, sometimes. White shirts 
have been replaced by t-shirts and flowered Hawaiian atrocities. 
"Dressing up" for a special occasion entails putting on jeans and 
a wrinkled shirt with a collar. If you happen to be domestically 
inclined, don't bother ironing shirts (or if you're not, feeling 
guilty about NOT ironing them) because pressed shirts are simply not a 
priority in a Techie's life and neither he nor any of his contemporaries 
will notice that the shirt he's wearing looks like it's been trapped 
between his mattress and box springs for a year.

Material possessions are of vital importance to the techie. Of 
paramount importance is: THE CAR. The cost of this is directly 
proportional to the size of: THE EGO. There are two types of vehicles 
owned by techies: 1966 station wagons with deteriorating wood on the 
sides OR the most expensive vehicle income will allow. (Neither 
category would be caught dead, however, driving a car with a Mary Kay 
bumper sticker attached.) Single techies can be identified by their 
dumpy apartments, frayed clothing and impeccably maintained Ferraris. 

Techies with vehicles in the second category assemble their machines 
for the annual Testosterone 500. Grown men gather at an area race 
track, spend 90 percent of the day walking around bragging about their 
car to anyone who will listen and devote the balance of the time 
tearing around on a track hoping they won't kill themselves. What we 
are witnessing is NOT simply a car race, but rather a battle of the 
egos. This same group of techies has also mastered the art of 
maneuvering discussion of THE CAR into every conversation. 

The home computer system is another source of competition. Our family 
of four (techie, SO, eight and two year old) is the proud owner of six 
computers, seven monitors, three laser printers, two dot matrix 
printers, two scanners, two optical disk drives, a CD ROM drive, and 
four boxes of cables that "might come in handy someday". Most 
appalling of all is that the two year old is limited to a 286 with an 
EGA! HORRORS! Special effort is made to explain to visiting techies 
that we are in the process of upgrading her system. 

Other elaborate electronic devices run a close second to the "home 
computer competition". Techies must always have the latest and the 
best of any electronic device on the market and they MUST be the first 
in their group to own one. We have established true superiority with 
our home PBX phone system with the capacity to handle ten incoming 
lines, conference calls, 45 auto-dial numbers and, best of all, music 
on hold. Oh, and our answering machine has voice mail capabilities, 
can receive fax transmissions and makes dinner. 

As you've probably already noticed, dating a techie has special 
challenges and rewards. Although your social hours are restricted to 
11:00 p.m. - 3:00 a.m., you do have the opportunity to meet other SO's 
who, like you, are hanging around the office waiting for "just one 
more compile". A techie's estimate of "15 more minutes" generally
means they will appear an hour or two later having absolutely no clue 
that more than 15 minutes has passed. 

If you do manage to convince your techie to take a vacation, plan on 
his inspecting the computer system at every hotel, gas station, 
restaurant, car rental agency and airline. Expect him to make 
suggestions for improvements to busboys, valets, maids and waiters, 
none of whom have the remotest interest in their establishment's 
computer system, much less any influence in this arena. Keep in mind 
also that no matter where you go, techies will find each other. The 
first trip I, my sweetie and his portable computer took together was 
to Europe. I was one of the lucky few to be dating a man who owned 
one of the first portable computers manufactured, which of course 
automatically entitled us to first class service everywhere. He no 
sooner had placed the computer on the airline tray table than six 
fellow techies leaped to his side to discuss the merits of the 
computer. Personal conversation with my traveling companion totalled 
ten minutes out of a six hour flight. 

Lunching with a group of techies is comparable to being dropped into a 
remote village in central Albania, with one major difference: Sign 
language is completely useless. They are speaking a foreign language 
and they are completely oblivious to this fact. My suggestion: Don't 
bother going. No one will notice that you were there anyway, including 
your techie. 

Parties dominated by techies are truly exciting experiences. Techies 
have never developed the art of smalltalk (their computers don't 
require this attribute) so don't expect to see a techie talking to a 
non-techie. If a techie was forced to bring his SO, he will feel 
obligated, however, to forego technical discussions for at least the 
first ten minutes. 

If you are unfortunate enough to be an SO with a "real job", you will 
encounter additional difficulties. The techie cannot fathom anyone 
going to work earlier than 10:00 a.m. He will tell you to simply 
inform your boss that you won't be starting until then. 

Techies are very well read. They devour books and articles on such 
exciting topics as memory management, VXD's and debugging but give 
them a book on relationships and watch the panic spread across their 
faces. Mention a couples workshop you think both of you should attend 
and watch those deadlines move up. 

At some point in their relationship, the SO must reveal to the
techie that a romantic holiday does not entail bringing along a 
portable computer, stacks of computer magazines and a trunkload 
of listings. They will be expected to spend an entire weekend 
without their computer! If you make it through this traumatic 
experience, a marriage or move-in-together proposal may be in the 
air. Expect any proposal to be very practical. Important issues 
such as what kind of dog you will get, how much money will be 
allotted to ego-related purchases, and how much space will be 
allocated for the special, hands-off place for his computers in 
your future home must be settled before a techie will even 
consider a permanent relationship. (Critical tip: This 
allotted space will double in size within six months, often 
spewing out into other areas of your home if you have not planned 
ahead.) Your wedding date will be arranged around development 
conferences, COMDEX and technical crises. 

If, at some point in your relationship, you decide to have children,
you will have to fit baby-making in between compiles. If you do 
manage to conceive, take a few photographs of your techie to tape over 
the baby's crib so your child will recognize your techie's face as 
well as his back. 

On a personal level, the techie is very supportive of his significant
other. When I decided to diet, my techie stood by me and agreed to 
diet with me; as long as he didn't have to give up Pepsi and Twinkies. 
When I determined that I needed a new look, he promised not to laugh 
when I came back with a new hairdo and agreed to unlimited funding for 
purchases made at lingerie shops. 

The techie is also an accomplished gift-giver. Just last month, for 
my birthday, my techie gave me a Bug Zapper. (You know, one of those 
things that vaporizes the bugs flying around on your patio.) It seems 
he "heard me mention that we should get one." Guess he missed the 
references to the diamond necklace and pearl earrings. Last Christmas 
I was the proud recipient of a portable toolkit -- it's a beaut. 

Well, I'd better close now. I'm due for my 10:43 appointment to 
review the 1991 COMDEX floor plan with you-know-who. Never a dull 
moment ...
