title: "'Twas The Night Before Christmas Tex-Mex Version"
---
Jim and Nita Lee (Dec. 1972) 

 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the casa,<br>
Not a creature was stirring -- Caramba! Que pasa?

 Los ninos were tucked away in their camas,<br>
Some in long underwear, some in pyjamas,

 While hanging the stockings with mucho cuidado<br>
In hopes that old Santa would feel obligado

 To bring all children, both buenos and malos,<br>
A nice batch of dulces and other regalos.

 Outside in the yard there arose such a grito<br>
That I jumped to my feet like a fightened cabrito.

 I ran to the window and looked out afuera,<br>
And who in the world do you think that it era?

 Saint Nick in a sleigh and a big red sombrero<br>
Came dashing along like a crazy bombero.

 And pulling his sleigh instead of venados<br>
Were eight little burros approaching volados.

 I watched as they came and this quaint little hombre<br>
Was shouting and whistling and calling by nombre:

 "Ay Pancho, ay Pepe, ay Cuco, ay Beto,<br>
Ay Chato, ay Chopo, Macuco, y Nieto!"

 Then standing erect with his hands on his pecho<br>
He flew to the top of our very own techo.

 With his round little belly like a bowl of jalea,<br>
He struggled to squeeze down our old chiminea,

 Then huffing and puffing at last in our sala,<br>
With soot smeared all over his red suit de gala,

 He filled all the stockings with lovely regalos --<br>
For none of the ninos had been very malos.

 Then chuckling aloud, seeming very contento,<br>
He turned like a flash and was gone like the viento.

 And I heard him exclaim, and this is verdad,<br>
Merry Christmas to all, and Feliz Navidad!
