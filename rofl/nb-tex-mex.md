title: "'Twas The Night Before Christmas Tex-Mex Version"
---
Jim and Nita Lee (Dec. 1972) </p>

 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the casa,<br>
Not a creature was stirring -- Caramba! Que pasa?</p>

 Los ninos were tucked away in their camas,<br>
Some in long underwear, some in pyjamas,</p>

 While hanging the stockings with mucho cuidado<br>
In hopes that old Santa would feel obligado</p>

 To bring all children, both buenos and malos,<br>
A nice batch of dulces and other regalos.</p>

 Outside in the yard there arose such a grito<br>
That I jumped to my feet like a fightened cabrito.</p>

 I ran to the window and looked out afuera,<br>
And who in the world do you think that it era?</p>

 Saint Nick in a sleigh and a big red sombrero<br>
Came dashing along like a crazy bombero.</p>

 And pulling his sleigh instead of venados<br>
Were eight little burros approaching volados.</p>

 I watched as they came and this quaint little hombre<br>
Was shouting and whistling and calling by nombre:</p>

 "Ay Pancho, ay Pepe, ay Cuco, ay Beto,<br>
Ay Chato, ay Chopo, Macuco, y Nieto!"</p>

 Then standing erect with his hands on his pecho<br>
He flew to the top of our very own techo.</p>

 With his round little belly like a bowl of jalea,<br>
He struggled to squeeze down our old chiminea,</p>

 Then huffing and puffing at last in our sala,<br>
With soot smeared all over his red suit de gala,</p>

 He filled all the stockings with lovely regalos --<br>
For none of the ninos had been very malos.</p>

 Then chuckling aloud, seeming very contento,<br>
He turned like a flash and was gone like the viento.</p>

 And I heard him exclaim, and this is verdad,<br>
Merry Christmas to all, and Feliz Navidad!</p>
