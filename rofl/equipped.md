[Note that this never actually happened](http://www.snopes.com/military/reinwald.htm),
though it makes a good story.

This has got to be the all-time classic comeback. This is [<a href="http://www.snopes.com/military/reinwald.htm">supposedly</a>] 
an exact recount of US National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female 
broadcaster,and US Army General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy scout 
Troop visiting his military installation.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: "So, General Reinwald, what things 
are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?"

GENERAL REINWALD: 'We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, 
archery, and shooting."

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: "Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, 
isn't it?"

 GENERAL REINWALD: "I don't see why, they'll be properly 
supervised on the rifle range."

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: "Don't you admit that this is a terribly 
dangerous activity to be teaching children?"

GENERAL REINWALD: "I don't see how, ....we will be teaching 
them proper rifle range discipline before they even touch a firearm."

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: "But you're equipping them to become 
violent killers."

GENERAL REINWALD: "Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, 
but you're not one, are you?"

The radio went silent and the interview ended.
