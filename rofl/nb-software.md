title: The software engineering process explained
---

'Twas the night before implementation and all through the house,<br>
Not a program was working not even a browse. </p>

 The programmers hung by their tubes in despair,<br>
with hopes that a miracle would soon be there.</p>

 The users were nestled all sung in their beds,<br>
while visions of inquiries danced in their heads.</p>

 When out in the machine room there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.</p>

 And what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
but a super programmer (with a six-pack of beer).</p>

 His resume glowed with experience so rare,<br>
he turned out great code with a bit-pusher's flair.</p>

 More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,<br>
and he cursed and muttered and called them by name:</p>

 On update! on add! on inquiry! on delete!<br>
on batch jobs! on closing! on functions complete!</p>

 His eyes were glazed-over, fingers nimble and lean,<br>
from weekends and nights in front of a screen.</p>

 A wink of his eye, and a twitch of his head,<br>
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>

 He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
turning specs into code; then turned with a jerk;</p>

 And laying his finger upon the "ENTER" key,<br>
the systems came up and worked perfectly.</p>

 The updates updated; the deletes, they deleted;<br>
the inquiries inquired, and closings completed.</p>

 He tested each whistle, and tested each bell,<br>
with nary an abend, and all had gone well.</p>

 The system was finished, the tests were concluded.<br>
The users' last changes were even included.</p>

 And the user exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,<br>
"It's just what I asked for, but not what I want!"</p>
