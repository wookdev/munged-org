on the toilet seat UP when you are done.</p>

include something from each of the four major male food groups: Meat, Fried, 
Beer, and Red.</p>

13. Any attempt by a man to prepare food, no matter how feeble 
(i.e. Microwaving a burrito, fixing Spaghetti, etc.) should be met with roughly 
the same degree of praise a parent might shower upon their infant when it walks 
for the first time.)</p>

14. Those male models with perfect bodies are all gay. Accept 
it.</p>

man you have ever met.</p>

fine, Looks fine/smells bad, Looks dirty/smells fine. Unless you intend to wash 
it, do not try to disrupt piles organized in this manner.</p>

37. Yes, Sharon Stone/Pamela Anderson/Cindy Crawford is prettier 
than you......Just like Brad Pitt/Antonio Banderas/Keanu Reeves is better looking
