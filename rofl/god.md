title: From newsgroup alt.atheism...

I have a God, too. Only most people call it a toilet. I have a special 
room in my house for my God and I visit it several times a day to see that 
it is getting enough water and nutrients. That way if people ask me if I believe 
in God, I can say:

"Of course I believe in God, there has always been a special place 
for God in my home and I sometimes feel very close to God. Just knowing that 
God is there is a source of great comfort to me."</cite> </p>

This is one of the best pieces I've read on alt.atheism in a while (which may 
tell you what I consider things to have been like lately ;-) This has great 
possibilities...</p>

"I once was a great sinner, indulging in strong drink, but one night 
in my wickedness I found myself kneeling before God, pouring out my repentance; 
evil spirits were expelled from me, and consumed by God. I prostrated myself 
before God then, and slept the sleep of the innocent."</p>

"Truly our society could not function without God. Not only is there 
a special place in **my** home for God, but in every true American 
home and place of business as well. I know that even when I travel I can turn 
to God in my time of need. Although our founding fathers did not know God 
exactly as we do today, they would never envision an America with no God at 
all. Those who reject God are defiled by their actions and risk spreading 
their filth to those around them."</p>

"My thoughts never stray too long away from God. At times when God 
seems farthest away, that is when then God is foremost in my thoughts."</p>

I'm sure now that I will be snickering for weeks at the most innocuous of theistic 
postings...</p>
