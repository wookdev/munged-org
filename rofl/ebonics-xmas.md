---

Twas da night befo' Christmas and all in the hood<br>
Not a homie was stirring cuz it was all good<br>
The tube socks was hung on the window sill<br>
and we all had smiles up on our grill<br>
Mookie and BeBe was snug in the crib<br>
in the back bedroom cuz that's how we live<br>
and moms in her do-rag and me with my nine<br>
had just gotten busy cuz girlfriend is fine<br>
All of a sudden a lowrider rolled by<br>
Bumpin phat beats cuz the system's fly<br>
I bounced to the window at a quarter pas'<br>
Bout ready to pop a cap in somebody's #$$!<br>
well anyway

I yelled to my lady, Yo peep this!<br>
She said, Stop frontin just mind yo' bidness<br>
I said, for real doe, come check dis out<br>
We weren't even buggin, no worries, no doubt<br>
Cuz bumpin an thumpin' from around da way<br>
Was Santa, 8 reindeer and a sleigh<br>
Da beats was kickin, da ride was phat<br>
I said, Yo red Dawg, you all that!<br>
He threw up a sign and yelled to his boyz,<br>
"Ay yo, give it up, let's make some noise!<br>
To the top of the projects and across the strip mall,<br>
We gots ta go, I got a booty call!"

He pulled up his ride on the top a da roof<br>
and sippin on a 40, he busted a move<br>
I yelled up to Santa, "Yo ain't got no stack!"<br>
he said, "Damn homie, deese projects is wack!<br>
But don't worry black, cuz I gots da skillz<br>
I learnt back when I hadda pay da billz."<br>
Out from his bag he pulled 3 small tings<br>
a credit card, a knife, and a bobby pin.<br>
he slid down the fire escape smoove as a cat<br>
and busted the window with a b-ball bat<br>
I said, "Whassup, Santa? Whydya bust my place?"<br>
he said,"You best get on up out my face!"<br>
His threads was all leatha, his chains was all gold<br>
His sneaks was Puma and they was 5 years old<br>
He dropped down the duffle, Clippers logo on the side<br>
Santa broke out da loot and my mouf popped open wide.<br>
A wink of his eye and a shine off his god toof<br>
He cabbage patched his way back onto the roof<br>
He jumped in his hooptie with rims made of chrome<br>
To tap that booty waitin at home<br>
and all I heard as he cruised outta sight<br>
was a loud and hearty.....<br>
"WEEESST SIIIIDE!!!!!!!"
