**Order:**  Is each here? Does each have his opposite?

**Chaos:**  I am here, but my opposite is you.

**Order:**  Huh?

**Evil:**  Don't let him bug ya'. We're here.

**Truth:**  My opposite is not here.

**Good:**  Is your opposite "Lies"?

**Truth:**  My opposite is "Void". He couldn't make it.

**Evil:**  >snicker< Figures!

**Order:**  Agh! How are we going to seat five! This table is made for six!

**Evil:**  Just take out his chair and move over. Sheesh!

**Good:**  I have the cards.

**Evil:**  I've got the chips.

**Truth:**  I have the beer.

**Chaos:**  I have the cards!

**Order:**  Shut up.

. . .

**Order:**  Whose deal is it?

**Evil:**  Do ya' gotta ask that EVERY time?

**Truth:**  It is Good's deal.

**Good:**  OK, five card draw...uh, everything is wild.

**Evil:**  How can anyone win if everything is wild?

**Good:**  No ONE can win, but we all can call ourselves winners if...

**Order:**  I like this game.

**Evil:**  This is pointless.

**Truth:**  It is time to deal.

**Good:**  Here we go! Your bet, Truth.

**Truth:**  Five.

**Order:**  Five and raise you five.

**Evil:**  Don't you morons get it? It doesn't matter how much you bet!

**Order:**  I like ten better.

**Evil:**  >sigh< Call.

**Chaos:**  I fold.

**Evil:**  YOU CAN'T LOSE!

**Chaos:**  I still fold.

**Good:**  OK, I'll call. How many, Truth?

**Evil:**  What's the point in taking more cards?

**Truth:**  I will keep the cards I have.

**Order:**  I will take two.

**Evil:**  Why?!?

**Order:**  I didn't like those.

**Evil:**  None for me.

**Chaos:**  I'll take six.

**Good:**  Sorry, you folded. Dealer keeps his. Bets?

**Evil:**  Oh, just get this over with.

**Order:**  But now we have to bet!

**Evil:**  Any money you put in, you're just gonna get back!

**Truth:**  I am in agreement with Evil. Let us show our cards.

**Truth:**  I have five aces.

**Order:**  I have five ace of spades.

**Chaos:**  I have a three.

**Good:**  Please be quiet. I also have five aces. We all win.

**Evil:**  Hold it, bub. Six aces, read'em and weep.

**Good:**  Where did you get that card?

**Truth:**  He stole it from Chaos.

**Evil:**  You know the rules, boys. The pot's mine.

**Good:**  That was a stupid game. 

**Order:**  Whose deal is it?

**Truth:**  The dealer progression is opposite the deal. Chaos deals.

**Chaos:**  Whee!

**all but Chaos:**  >groan<

**Chaos:**  Eleven card stud-hold'em with threes, eights, 
jacks, and kings wild...fives count as fours, fours count as nines, and queens 
don't count unless there is a prime numbered spade showing... 

**Order:**  I fold...
