title: What The Org Chart Doesn't Tell You
---
 
In the lower ranks of the MIS world, sorting out job titles is a nearly impossible 
task. Some folks are called Analysts. Some are called Programmers. Some are 
called Engineers. None of them has window offices.

So I have listed -- from lowest to highest in order of prestige -- and described 
the 10 most commonly used job titles in a data processing shop.

A truly experienced high-tech professional has held five or even six of these 
positions ...usually all at the same time.

<dl>
<dt>10. Programmer:</dt>
<dd> 
  This person holds the lowest rank in the DP field. Manages no one. Answers 
    to everyone. Approximately 50% of the Programmer's time is scheduled for 
    testing. Another 50% is spent filling out time cards and progress reports. 
    Any time left over is spent attending classes on technologies that will 
    never be used in the shop. 
</dd>
<dd> 
  The Programmer is appraised on code quality and reliability. Never has 
    time to write any. Hopes to, someday, be promoted to Systems Analyst.
</dd>
<dt>9. Systems Analyst:</dt>
<dd> 
  The Systems Analyst refuses to code anymore. Designs new systems. Writes 
    specs for new systems. Devises procedures and work flows for new systems 
    but ends up training users on how to get by with the old ones. Next in line 
    for Team Leader position.
</dd>
<dt>8. Team Leader:</dt>
<dd> 
  A Team Leader manages one project. Doesn't know why he's not called Project 
    Leader; that's what he has on his resume.
</dd>
<dt>7. Project Leader:</dt>
<dd> 
  Manages several projects at once. Analyzes Gantt charts from the Team Leaders' 
    projects. Coordinates schedules from the Team Leaders' projects. Monitors 
    deliverables from the Team Leaders' projects. Has absolutely no idea what 
    any of the Team Leaders' projects are about. Wants to be a programmer again.
</dd>
<dt>6. Operator:</dt>
<dd> 
  The Operator wields powers that the Project Leader can only dream about. 
    Makes Programmers beg for tape drives. Makes Analysts beg for disk space. 
    Makes Team Leaders beg for printouts. Has an uncanny understanding of career 
    potential in the data processing industry. Going to law school at night. 
  
</dd>
<dt>5. Systems Programmer:</dt>
<dd> 
  Even an Operator wants to be a Systems Programmer. A Systems Programmer 
    has the authority to wipe out disk packs without warning. Crash the system 
    during user demos. Make new releases appear, then disappear, then reappear 
    again, especially during month-end processing. 
</dd>
<dt>4. DBA:</dt>
<dd> 
  No one really knows what the Database Administrator does, and no one is 
    smart enough to know if the DBA is doing it or not. But every shop must 
    have one DBA, because no place can afford two of them.
</dd>
<dt>3. Manager:</dt>
<dd> 
  The Manager is sometimes called a Director. Or an Assistant Vice-President. 
    Or an Account Manager. Has completely lost touch with any facsimile of technology. 
    Wants to finish next year's budget. Wants to finish last year's appraisals. 
    Wants to learn the names of some of the Programmers. But instead, only has 
    time to interview job applicants, usually DBAs.
</dd>
<dt>2. Department Secretary:</dt>
<dd> 
  The Programmers have word processing. The Managers have electronic mail. 
    Everyone has automatic phone messaging. This leaves the Department Secretary 
    with all kinds of time to manipulate, control and dispense the three most 
    basic employee needs: paychecks, rumors, and supplies. Can make copier self-destruct 
    just by going to lunch.
</dd>
<dt>1. Contract Programmer:</dt>
<dd> 
  A Contract Programmer doesn't have to wear a nice suit. Or go to meetings. 
    Or fill out time cards. Or keep complaints to himself. He can make all the 
    mistakes he wants. He doesn't get benefits. He doesn't get training. He 
    doesn't get respect.
</dd>
<dd> 
   But after years in the trenches, the Contract Programmer will finally 
    achieve the ultimate goal in the profession: He will be able to make impossible 
    deadlines with inadequate resources for desperate managers by putting in 
    all kinds of extra hours... and will be paid overtime for every one of them.
</dd>
