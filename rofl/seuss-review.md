title: A Review of Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs And Ham
---

by Matt Mason

Green Eggs And Ham is a book which certainly caught me by surprise. 
I hardly expected a book with a bright orange cover and a goofy feline in the 
upper-right corner saying "I Can Read It All By Myself: Beginner Books" 
to be such a stunningly frank analysis of human sexual maturation. But Seuss 
certainly defies the reader's expectations, and he does so wonderfully. </p>

 The book begins with one character rolling across the pages 
with a sign reading "I am Sam" (3) and then "Sam I am" (7). 
Seuss starts off with a blatant Judeo-Christian Yahweh image, recalling God's 
response to Moses on Mt. Sinai when Moses asked who was speaking to him, and 
God replied with a resounding, "I AM" (Exodus 3:14). Here, Seuss gives 
us a softer "I am," cleverly mixing the Christian with the pre-Christian 
in the form of Sam, a character who begins with the omnipotent cry of the Biblical 
God but whose name and playfulness hint that he is also to be considered a Pan-like 
character.</p>

 We then see Sam approach the book's other character, an unnamed 
Everyman whom he offers the green eggs and ham. The eggs are clearly symbolic 
of the female ovum, the ham (the meat) being the male penis, and the green coloration 
is a common symbol of springtime, new life, the awakening of sexual urges. So 
Sam is not simply offering food, Sam is questioning our young Everyman about 
sexual desires.</p>

 At first, Everyman only sees these urges as an unwelcome distraction, 
proclaiming, "...That Sam-I-am!/ I do not like/ that Sam-I-am!" and 
then denouncing the green eggs and ham, striking out at and denying the strangeness 
and discomfort of the biological stirrings working within (9).</p>

 And so Sam begins testing Everyman. He begins in a simple yet 
existential way, asking, "Would you like them/ here or there?" effectively 
asking if Everyman would prefer that sex be in a conservative, imaginable fashion 
in the "here" or in the unexpected, the different, distant, far-out 
"there" (14).</p>

 But Everyman refuses to even consider it, turning away from 
Sam.</p>

 No sooner has Everyman's back turned, though, and Sam appears 
again and demands attention. This time, he asks, "Would you like them/ 
in a house?" (19). Sam attempts to see if Everyman's doubts about sex stem 
from the fear of possibly starting a family and being financially unable to 
care for them; if Everyman was prosperous, owned a house, would that soothe 
Everyman's negativity towards sex?</p>

 Sam also takes this opportunity to ask, "Would you like 
them/ with a mouse?" indicating a timid partner for Everyman (19). Sam 
wonders if the sexual experience scares Everyman, and perhaps a submissive, 
non-threatening partner, symbolized by the mouse, would be what Everyman needs 
to be comfortable with his/her own sexuality.</p>

 But, again, the answer is resoundingly negative, a denouncement 
of the natural gifts represented by the green eggs and ham.</p>

 Our plucky little Pan is far from satisfied, though, and returns 
in Everyman's path, asking, "Would you eat them in a box?" (22). His 
earlier question about the house was, perhaps, not relevant; so Sam wonders 
if Everyman would prefer simple, more hardy circumstances. Nothing fancy, nothing 
expensive, just the spare setting of a box.</p>

 Like before, he joins this with a second question, asking,"Would 
you eat them with a fox", an obvious counter to the timid mouse-partner 
of before (22). Now Sam asks if Everyman would prefer a wilder partner, someone 
beautiful and inventive; the fox representing not only beauty in the American 
fashion, but the wisdom and cunning of older, European folklore.</p>

But Everyman simply repudiates all of Sam's offers:</p>

> Not in a box.<br>
> Not with a fox.<br>
> Not in a house.<br>
> Not with a mouse.<br>
> I would not eat them here or there.<br>
> I would not eat them anywhere.<br>
> I would not eat green eggs and ham.<br>
> I do not like them, Sam-I-am. (24)

Everyman claims empirical control over these boiling urges. 
By stating, "I would not eat them anywhere", Everyman steadfastly 
refuses to give in to any aspect of sexual curiosity. Even so, we can see that 
it's unsettling, as the frantic and lengthy reply to Sam shows.</p>

And then Sam tries a different angle. He wonders if what Everyman 
needs to "turn on" is something technological, modern, perhaps electrical 
or synthetic. He asks the bold question,"Would you? Could you/ in a car?" 
(26). Sam hints in Freudian terms that perhaps sex could spur on Everyman's 
movement of the ego through the transportation symbol of the car.</p>

 But, as before, Everyman rejects this.</p>

 So Sam counters with, "You may like them / in a tree!" 
(28). If technology may seem a bit shaky to Everyman, it seems logical that 
nature, symbolized by the tree, is what it takes to make this Everyman recognize 
and respond to his inner stirrings, inner stirrings which can be said to be 
nothing more than common and natural in all living creatures.</p>

 Steadfast and determined, Everyman again rejects Sam's questions, 
but the lengthy answer (again rejecting the box, fox, house, mouse, etc.) shows 
that Sam's (nature's) persistence is unsettling Everyman.</p>

 So Sam immediately hits with, "A train! A train!/ A train! 
A train!/ Could you, would you, on a train?" (33). Sam is tempting Everyman 
by exclaiming (four times! just like there are four compass directions, four 
corners of the world, etc.) a symbol of even larger ego movement than the car! 
Here, Seuss uses a strong symbol of fertility; with its phallic shape and sexual 
rhythm, when trains were first introduced to less developed nations, sometimes 
women would gather near the train tracks and lift their skirts as the train 
passed, believing the virile train would fertilize them. So here, Sam tests 
to see if what Everyman desires is great power, growth, and fertility.</p>

 Again, Everyman curtly refuses, lamenting, "Not on a train!! 
Not in a tree!/ Not in a car! Sam! Let me be!/ I would not, could not, in a 
box," etc. (34).</p>

 This train section's placement is particularly important. In 
Sam's inquest, I mark nine clear sections (counting the car and tree as one 
section, similar to "box and fox" and "house and mouse" 
since they are clearly paired up as opposites) and this is the fifth, the central 
one. This section clarifies that the issue preventing Everyman from giving in 
to Sam's questioning is deeper than a physical impotence, as Everyman is here 
symbolically offered great virility. It's Seuss' way of letting us know that 
we should be looking deeper when Everyman replies"I would not, could not."</p>

 Sam then continues, testing to see if what Everyman wants is 
mystery, perhaps danger, asking, "Would you, could you, in the dark?" 
(36). There's no reason to believe that Sam here refers to a sinful dark, it 
seems more a darkness where inhibitions are lowered, a more soothing venue in 
which Everyman could feel more comfortable and less self-conscious about sexual 
expression. It could also be a dark of fear, as Sam must honestly admit that 
sexual expression has many frightening aspects in the forms of diseases, unwanted 
pregnancies, the pain of giving birth, etc.; Sam moves from the easier, fluffier 
approach to a more honest one with this.</p>

 And Everyman gives the constant reply, "I would not, could 
not..." (37).</p>

 Sam then tries to see if sex for more hedonistic reasons would 
appeal to Everyman. "Would you, could you,/ in the rain?" (38). In 
almost all mythologies, water represents life, as that's what rivers and spring 
rains bring to agricultural societies. So would Everyman have sex if, not just 
being life-creating in the form of offspring, it were a life-giving act for 
Everyman, a refreshment, a germination, a baptism into new life, new awareness?</p>

 Again, No.</p>

 Here, then, Sam stops and asks simply, "You do not like/ 
green eggs and ham?" (40) to the expected reply of, "I do not/ like 
them,/ Sam-I-am" (41). I find it fascinating that Sam here returns to the 
basic question. This underscores how far Sam has come from that basic question 
and shown many facets to human sexuality.</p>

 And then Sam continues, "Could you, would you,/ with a 
goat?" a surprising and pivotal question at this point (42). At first we 
wonder why Seuss would bring in such a bizarre animal here, but the answer, 
of course, comes from the ancient Greeks. As most competent drama students could 
tell you, the Greeks had a ceremony where they would take a goat and ritually 
place the collective sins and problems of the village on the poor beast, then 
beat it and send it away as a purification of the village. Here, Sam tries to 
show sex as a purifying act, asking Everyman to see that sins and hang-ups have 
no place here, they can be exorcised as God is not the prudish God of some interpretations 
but an earthier God who asks us to embrace our sexual natures.</p>

 And then, finally, Sam asks, "Would you, could you,/ on 
a boat" (44). Sam indicates a more massive movement of the ego than either 
the car or the train of before. Slower, yes, but larger. Plus the entire purpose 
of the boat is to travel on top of the water, on top of life-giving forces vastly 
larger than the rain Sam brought up earlier.</p>

Yet Everyman still replies:</p>

> I would not, could not, on a boat.<br>
> I will not, will not, with a goat.<br>
> I will not eat them in the rain.<br>
> I will not eat them on a train.<br>
> Not in the dark! Not in a tree!<br>
> Not in a car! You let me be!<br>
> I do not like them in a box.<br>
> I do not like them with a fox.<br>
> I will not eat them in a house.<br>
> I do not like them with a mouse.<br>
> I do not like them here or there.<br>
> I do not like them ANYWHERE! (46)</p>
>
> I do not like<br>
> green eggs<br>
> and ham! (49)</p>
>
> I do not like them, <br>
> Sam-I-am. (50)</p>

 As Everyman says this, notice how it slows down from an orderly 
list of what Everyman does not like to the shifting of the structure into smaller, 
enjambed lines. This change is actually best conveyed by the illustration which 
Seuss uses at this point in the book. His drawing shows the boat, which Sam 
had just brought up, sinking to leave him and Everyman immersed in an ocean: 
no longer floating atop life and nature and mystery but actually swimming in 
it!</p>

 Here, the narrative leaves the theoretical, as Sam no longer 
asks, he states:</p>

> You do not like them.<br>
>  So you say.<br>
>  Try them! Try them!<br>
>  And you may.<br>
>  Try them and you may, I say. (53)</p>

And Everyman finally gives in! Out of sheer exhaustion, he takes 
a bite and is immediately electrified:</p>

> Say!<br>
>  I like green eggs and ham!<br>
>  I do! I like them, Sam-I-am!<br>
>  And I would eat them in a boat.<br>
>  And I would eat them with a goat... (59)<br>
>  And I will eat them in the rain.<br>
>  And in the dark. And on a train.<br>
>  And in a car. And in a tree.<br>
>  They are so good, so good, you see! (60)<br>
>  So I will eat them in a box.<br>
>  And I will eat them with a fox.<br>
>  And I will eat them in a house.<br>
>  And I will eat them with a mouse.<br>
>  And I will eat them here and there.<br>
>  Say! I will eat them ANYWHERE! (61)</p>

It is a long journey, but Seuss shows that the persistence of 
nature (or our God-given biological urges) can eventually wear down anyone. 
As Everyman goes through the full journey of sexual maturation, Everyman discovers 
all the things that sexual expression can be, until, in that climactic scene, 
everything falls into place; Everyman is both worn down by Sam's persistence 
and fully aware of the complexity of all the facets to a blooming sexuality, 
causing Everyman to try and then to joyfully embrace the "green eggs and 
ham."</p>

 Through this simple narrative, Dr. Seuss has created a brilliant 
account of human coming-of-age. It also contains a message that sex is not something 
to feel ashamed of, for did not even the Judeo-Christian God ask us to "go 
forth and multiply" (Genesis 9:7)? Seuss shows us that a well-informed, 
even skeptically approached sexuality can be a good thing, as this is no ignorant, 
uninformed desire; Everyman is careful, realizing all that sex can be before 
embracing it!</p>
