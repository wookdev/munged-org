title: What McGreggor Done
---
 
 
THE SETTING:</p>
 
An old timer in Scotland, in a Glasgow pub, talking to a young man.</p>
 
Old Man:</p>
 
"Lad, look out there to the field. Do ya see that fence? Look how well 
it's built. I built that fence stone by stone with me own two hands.
I piled it for months. But do they
call me McGreggor-the-Fence-Builder?
Nooo.."</p>
 
Then the old man gestured at the bar.
"Look here at the bar. Do ya see how
smooth and just it is? I planed that
surface down by me own achin' back.
I carved that wood with me own hard
labour, for eight days. But do they
call me McGreggor-the-Bar-builder?
Nooo..."</p>
 
Then the old man points out the window.</p>
 
"Eh, Laddy, look out to sea. Do ya see
that pier that stretches out as far
as the eye can see? I built that pier
with the sweat off me back. I nailed it
board by board. But do they call me
McGreggor-the-Pier-Builder? Nooo..."</p>
 
Then the old man looks around nervously, trying to make sure no one is paying 
attention.</p>
 
"But ya shag one goat . . ."</p>
