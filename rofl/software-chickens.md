title: Software Chicken Crossing
---

Some software humor. (And, in its way, a useful primer on the varying characteristics 
of different operating systems, development languages, and software vendors.)
<dl>
<dt> NT Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Will cross the road in June. No, August. September for sure.
</dd>
<dt> OS/2 Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  It crossed the road in style years ago, but it was so quiet that nobody 
    noticed.
</dd>
<dt>Win 95 Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  You see different colored feathers while it crosses, but cook it and it 
    still tastes like ... chicken.
</dd>
<dt>Microsoft Chicken (TM):</dt>
<dd> 
  It's already on both sides of the road. And it just bought the road.
</dd>
<dt>OOP Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  It doesn't need to cross the road, it just sends a message.
</dd>
<dt>Assembler Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  First it builds the road ...
</dd>
<dt>C Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  It crosses the road without looking both ways.
</dd>
<dt>C++ Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  The chicken wouldn't have to cross the road, you'd simply refer to him 
    on the other side.
</dd>
<dt>VB Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  USHighways!TheRoad.cross (aChicken)
</dd>
<dt>Delphi Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  The chicken is dragged across the road and dropped on the other side.
</dd>
<dt>Java Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  If your road needs to be crossed by a chicken, the server will download 
    one to the other side. (Of course, those are chicklets)
</dd>
<dt>Web Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Jumps out onto the road, turns right, and just keeps on running.
</dd>
<dt>Gopher Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Tried to run, but got flattened by the Web chicken.
</dd>
<dt>Newton Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Can't cluck, can't fly, and can't lay eggs, but you can carry it across 
    the road in your pocket !
</dd>
<dt>Cray Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Crosses faster than any other chicken, but if you don't dip it in liquid 
    nitrogen first, it arrives on the other side fully cooked.
</dd>
<dt>Quantum Logic Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  The chicken is distributed probabilistically on all sides of the road until 
    you observe it on the side of your course.
</dd>
<dt>Lotus Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Don't you *dare* try to cross the road the same way we do!
</dd>
<dt>Mac Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  No reasonable chicken owner would want a chicken to cross the road, so 
    there's no way to tell it to.
</dd>
<dt>Al Gore Chicken:</dt>
<dd> 
  Waiting for completion of NCI (National Chicken-crossing Infrastructure) 
    and will cross as soon as it's finished, assuming he's re-elected and the 
    Republicans don't gut the program.
</dd>
<dt>COBOL Chicken:</dt>
<dd>
