For decades, two heroic statues, one male and one female, faced each other 
in a city park, until one day an angel came down from heaven. 

"You've been such exemplary statues," he announced to them, "That 
I'm going to give you a special gift. I'm going to bring you both to life for 
thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want." And with a clap 
of his hands, the angel brought the statues to life. 

The two approached each other a bit shyly, but soon dashed for the bushes, 
from which shortly emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of 
branches. Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged from the bushes, wide 
grins on their faces. 

"You still have fifteen more minutes," said the angel, winking at 
them. 

Grinning even more widely the female statue turned to the male statue and said, 
"Great! Only this time you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on it's head."
