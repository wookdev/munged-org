title: "'Twas the night before Solstice"
---
 
by James Finn Garner

'Twas the night before solstice and all through the co-op<br>
Not a creature was messing the calm status quo up.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
Dreaming of lentils and warm whole-grain breads.

We'd welcomed the winter that day after school<br>
By dancing and drumming and burning the Yule,

A more meaningful gesture to honor the planet<br>
Than buying more trinkets for Mom or Aunt Janet,

Or choosing a tree just to murder and stump it<br>
And dress it all up like a seasonal strumpet.

My lifemate and I, having turned down the heat,<br>
Slipped under the covers for a well-deserved sleep,

When from out on the lawn there came such a roar<br>
I fell from my futon and rolled to the floor.

I crawled to the window and pulled back the latch,<br>
And muttered, "Aw, where is that Neighborhood Watch?"

 I saw there below through the murk of the night<br>
 A sleigh and eight reindeer of nonstandard height.

 At the reins of that sleigh sat a mean-hearted knave<br>
 Who treated each deer like his personal slave.

 I'd seen him before in some ads for car loans,<br>
 Plus fast food and soft drinks and cellular phones.

 He must have cashed in from his mercantile chores,<br>
 Since self-satisfaction just oozed from his pores.

He called each by name, as if he were right<br>
To treat them like humans, entrenching his might:

"Now Donder, now Blitzen," and other such aliases,<br>
Showing his true Eurocentrical biases.

With a snap of his fingers away they all flew,<br>
 Like lumberjacks served up a plate of tofu.

 Up to the rooftop they carried the sleigh<br>
 (The holes in the shingles are there to this day).

 Out bounded the man, who went straight to the flue.<br>
 I knew in an instant just what I should do.

 After donning my slippers, downstairs did I dash<br>
 to see this trespasser emerge from the ash.

 His clothes were all covered with soot, but of course,<br>
 From our wood-fueled alternative energy source.

 Through the grime I distinguished the make of his duds--<br>
 He was dressed all in fur, fairly dripping with blood.

 "We're a cruelty-free house!" I proclaimed with 
such heat<br>
 He was startled and tripped on the logs at his feet.

 He stood back up dazed, but with mirth in his eyes.<br>
 It was then that I noticed his unhealthy size.

 He was almost as wide as when standing erect,<br>
 A lover of fatty fried foods, I suspect.

 But that wasn't all to make sane persons choke:<br>
 In his teeth sat a pipe that was belching out smoke!

 I could scarcely believe what invaded our house.<br>
 This carcinogenic and overweight louse

 Was so red in the face from his energy spent,<br>
 I expected a heart attack right there and then.

 Behind him he toted a red velvet bag<br>
 Full to exploding with sinister swag.

 He asked, "Where is your tree?" with a face somewhat 
long.<br>
 I said, "Out in the yard, which is where it belongs."

 "But where will I put all the presents I've brought?"<br>
 I looked at him squarely and said, "Take the lot

 "To some frivolous people who think that they need<br>
 to succumb to the sickness of commerce and greed,

 "Whose only joy comes from the act of consuming,<br>
 Thus sending the stock of the retailers booming."

 He blinked and said, "Ho, ho, ho! But you're kidding."<br>
 I gave him a stare that was stern and forbidding.

 "Surely children need something with which to have 
fun?<br>
 It's like childhood's over before it's begun."

 He looked in my eyes for some sign of assent,<br>
 But I strengthened my will and refused to relent.

 "They have plenty of fun," I cut to the gist,<br>
 "And your mindless distractions have never been missed.

 "They take CPR so that they can save lives,<br>
 And go door-to-door for the used clothing drives.

 "They recycle, renew, reuse -- and reveal<br>
 For saving the planet a laudable zeal.

 "When they padlock themselves to a fence to protest<br>
 Against nuclear power, we think they're the best."

 He said, "But they're children -- lo, when do they 
play?"<br>
 I countered, "Is that why you've driven your sleigh,

 "To bring joy to the hearts of each child and tot?<br>
 All right, open your bag; let's see what you've got."

 He sheepishly did as I'd asked and behold!<br>
 A Malibu Barbie in a skirt made of gold.

 "You think that my girls will like playing with this,<br>
 An icon of sexist, consumerist kitsch?

 "With it's unnatural figure and airheaded grin,<br>
 This trollop makes every girl yearn to be thin,

 "And take up fad diets and bingeing and purging<br>
 Instead of respecting her own body's urging

 "To welcome the shape that her body has found<br>
 And rejoice to be lanky, short, skinny, or round."

 Deep in his satchel he searched for a toy,<br>
 Saying, "This is a hit with most little boys."

 And what did he put in my trembling hand<br>
 But a gun from the BrainBlaster Power Command!

 "It's a 'hit,' to be sure," I sneered in his face,<br>
 "And a plague to infect the whole human race!

 "How 'bout grenades or some working bazookas<br>
 To turn all of our kids into half-wit palookas?"

 I seized on his bag just to see for myself<br>
 The filth being spread by this odious elf.

 An Easy-Bake Oven -- ah, goddess, what perfidy!<br>
 To hoodwink young girls into household captivity!

 Plus an archer play set with shafts that fly out,<br>
 The very thing needed to put your eye out.

 And toy metal tractors, steam shovels, and cranes<br>
 For tearing down woodlands and scarring the plains,

 Plus "games" like Monopoly, Pay Day, Tycoon,<br>
 As if lessons in greed can't start up too soon.

 And even more weapons from BrainBlastersCo.,<br>
 Like cannons and nunchucks and ray guns that glow.

 That's all I could find in his red velvet sack --<br>
 Perverseness and mayhem to set us all back.

 (But I did find one book that caused me to ponder --<br>
 Some fine bedtime tales by a fellow named Garner.)

 "We need none of this," I announced in a huff,<br>
 "No 'business-as-usual' holiday stuff.

 "We sow in our offspring more virtue than this.<br>
 Your 'toys' offer some things they never will miss."

 The big man's expression was a trifle bereaved<br>
 As he shouldered his pack and got ready to leave.

 "I pity the kids who grow up around here,<br>
 Who're never permitted to be of good cheer,

 "Who aren't allowed leisure for leisure's own sake,<br>
 But must fret every minute -- it makes my heart break!"

 "Enough histrionics! Don't pity our kids<br>
 If they don't do as Macy's or Toys 'R' Us bids.

 "They live by their principles first and foremost<br>
 And know what's important," to him did I boast.

 "Pray, could I meet them" "Oh no, they're 
not here.<br>
 They're up on the roof, liberating your deer!"

 Then Santa Claus sputtered and pointed his finger<br>
 But, mad as he was, he had no time to linger.

 He flew up the chimney like smoke from a fire,<br>
 And up on the roof I heard voices get higher.

 I ran outside the co-op to see him react<br>
 To my children's responsible, kindhearted act.

 He chased them away, and disheartened, dismayed,<br>
 He rehitched his reindeer (who'd docilely stayed).

 I watched with delight as he scooted off then.<br>
 He'd be too embarrassed to come back again.

 But with parting disdain, do you know what he said,<br>
 When this overweight huckster took off in his sled?

 This reindeer enslaver, this exploiter of elves?<br>
 "Happy Christmas to all, but get over yourselves!!"
