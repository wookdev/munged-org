title: Men's Restroom Etiquette
---
 
Men should ace this test ... women may have a little difficulty.

## There is a code of "Restroom Etiquette" that MUST be followed. 

The following is the urinal configuration in a sample men's room.
An X above the number will indicate "in use."

    (Sample):
  
    |   |   | x |   |   | x |  (Indicates that urinals 3 and 6
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |   are occupied.)
  

You are to identify correctly, based on urinal etiquette, at which stall you are to stand. Good luck!

## Easy Section


    |   | x |   | x |   |   |  (Urinals 2 and 4 occupied.)
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

    Your choice: ___

Correct answer: 6 - It's the ONLY one to go to and every guy instinctively knows this.

    | x |   |   |   |   |   | (Urinal 1 occupied.) 
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 
    Your choice: ___

Correct answer: 6 - Stall 5 is acceptable, but you run a greater risk of being next to
someone who arrives later.

## Kind of tricky Section: 

    |   |   |   |   |   |   |  (empty) 
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
  
    Your choice: __

 Correct answer: 1 or 6 - You are tacitly saying, "I don't want anyone next to me."
 
    |   | x |   | x |   | x |  (2, 4 and 6 occupied)
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   
    Your choice: ___

Correct answer: 1 - You're stuck being 
next to at least ONE guy, so you minimize the impact and get a wall on your 
left. NEVER go between TWO guys if you can help it. Exceptions to this are stadium 
restrooms where the herd thunders in.

## Subtle, tricky, but important to know Section  

    |   | x |   |   | x | x |  (2, 5 and 6 occupied) 
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   
    Your choice: __

Correct answer: 4 - Believe it or not, 1 and 3 "couples" you with the guy in
stall 2. And we wouldn't want THAT now, would we?

This differs from the previous question in such a subtle way that the nuances
cannot be explained. Suffice to say, only we men would understand!

## VERY tricky indeed Section 

    | x | x |   |   | x | x |  (1, 2, 5 and 6 occupied) 
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   
    Your choice: ___

Correct answer: NONE! You go to the 
mirror and pretend to comb your hair or straighten a tie until the urinals "open 
up" a bit more. If you have to go REAL, REAL BAD, for god's sake! ... use 
a doored stall.

Other parts of the Unwritten Code of the Urinals:
* NO Talking, unless it's a good friend... 
  but even then, keep it terse and unemotional. This ain't no clubhouse.
* I don't think I need to tell you, absolutely NO touching of anyone other
  han yourself. A touch of another's elbow is of the highest offense.
* NO Singing. Period.
* Glances are for purposes of acknowledgment only..."Yeah, I see you
  there. I will not look again".
