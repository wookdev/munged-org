I have a spelling checker<br>

It plane lee marks four my revue<br>
Miss steaks aye can knot see.

Eye ran this poem threw it.<br>
Your sure real glad two no.<br>
Its very polished in its weigh,<br>
My checker tolled me sew.

A checker is a blessing.<br>
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.<br>
It helps me right awl stiles two reed,<br>
And aides me when aye rime.

Each frays comes posed up on my screen<br>
Eye trussed too bee a joule.<br>
The checker pours o'er every word<br>
To cheque sum spelling rule.

Bee fore wee rote with checkers<br>
Hour spelling was inn deck line,<br>
Butt now when wee dew have a laps,<br>
Wee are not maid too wine.

And now bee cause my spelling<br>
Is checked with such grate flare,<br>
There are know faults in awl this peace,<br>
Of nun eye am a wear.

To rite with care is quite a feet<br>
Of witch won should be proud,<br>
And wee mussed dew the best wee can,<br>
Sew flaws are knot aloud.

That's why eye brake in two averse<br>
Cuz Eye dew want too please.<br>
Sow glad eye yam that aye did bye<br>
This soft wear four pea seas.

Note: "cheque" and "Cuz" both were flagged as wrong by the spelling checker in Dreamweaver MX.
