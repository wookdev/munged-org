title: The End of the Raven
---

by Edgar Allen Poe's cat
 
On a night quite unenchanting, when the rain was downward slanting,<br>
I awakened to the ranting of the man I catch mice for.<br>
Tipsy and a bit unshaven, in a tone I found quite craven,<br>
Poe was talking to a raven perched above the chamber door.<br>
"Raven's rather tasty," mused I, tiptoeing o'er the floor,<br>
"There is nothing I like more."
 
Soft upon the rug I treaded, calm and careful as I headed<br>
Toward his roost atop that dreaded bust of Pallas I deplore.<br>
While the bard and birdie chattered, I made certain nothing clattered,<br>
Creaked, or snapped, or fell, or shattered, as I crossed the corridor;<br>
For his house is crammed with trinkets, curios and weird decor--<br>
Bric-a-brac and junk galore.
 
Still the Raven never fluttered, standing stock-still as he uttered,<br>
In a voice that shrieked and sputtered, his two-cents' worth: "Nevermore."<br>
While this dirge the birdbrain kept up, oh, so silently I crept up,<br>
Then I crouched and quickly leapt up, pouncing on the feathered bore.<br>
Soon he was a heap of plumage, and a little blood and gore--<br>
Only this and not much more.
 
"Oh!" my pickled poet cried out, "Pussycat, it's time I dried out!<br>
Never sat I in my hideout talking to a bird before.<br>
How I've wallowed in self-pity, while my gallant, valiant kitty<br>
Put an end to that damned ditty!" Then I heard him start to snore.<br>
Back atop the door I clambered, eyeing that statue I abhor,<br>
Jumped--and smashed it on the floor.
