title: On the Net Before Christmas
---

On the night before Christmas, when all through the house, <br>
not a creature was stirring, just me and my mouse. <br>
The modem and dialer were both working fine,<br>
I hoped my computer would soon be on line. <br>
The rest of the family were all snug in their beds, <br>
While I was in front of my PC instead. </p>
 
 When from the sound card there arose such a clatter, <br>
I sprang to my feet yelling, "What is the matter?" <br>
I moved back to windows in less than a flash<br>
for fear the whole thing was ready to crash. </p>
 
 The LED shone with a peaceful green glow, <br>
As my hard drive assured me, "It's all systems are go!" <br>
And then what a magical website appeared, <br>
Information and pointers to help make things clear. <br>
Whatever I needed, I could get extra quick, <br>
I followed instructions to just point and click, </p>
 
 More rapid than zip files, the e-mail it came. <br>
From senders and from servers with strange-sounding names. <br>
Like Yahoo, and Lycos, Like Delphi and Pipeline, <br>
Archie or Netscape or America Online. </p>
 
 'Til Eudora was filled to the brim with replies <br>
I feared I'd been spammed in the blink of and eye. <br>
But then Like a wild blizzard blown down from the north, <br>
I saw page after page from my printer swirl forth. </p>
 
 So back to the internet quickly I flew. <br>
With a fistful of chat groups and their addresses, too. <br>
And then, in a twinkling, I started to scan <br>
Websites and home pages from throughout the land. <br>
As I entered each one and was looking around, <br>
I discovered that links to more sites could be found. </p>
 
 I got horoscopes, health service, fashion tips, too. <br>
There were quotes from the stock exchange, and movie reviews! <br>
From forums and focus groups on car repair - <br>
To "Check Your Own Prostate!" -- I went everywhere. </p>
 
 Through cartoons and show tunes I happily rambled, <br>
At Harvard I studied, in Vegas I gambled. <br>
I visited towers from Trump to the Eiffel, <br>
I learned how to lock, load and fire a rifle. </p>
 
 And having learned that, I went on safari, <br>
Then crossed the wide sands of the great Kalahari, <br>
The steamy rain forest, the temples of Athens, <br>
The tombs of the Pharaohs, the streets of Manhattan, </p>
 
 I visited landmarks and natural wonders, <br>
Saw polar bears up north, koalas Down Under, <br>
Danced with Baryshnikov, sang with the Beatles, <br>
Fly fished in Idaho, rumbaed in Rio. </p>
 
 Ran with the bulls in the streets of Pamplona, <br>
Had quite the adventures all the world over, <br>
There still were a thousand more places to go. <br>
But the hour was late, the moon it was low. </p>
 
 Just one more inquiry before I retired, <br>
'Til the next thing I knew, the whole night had expired <br>
And my family exclaimed as the morning dawned red, <br>
"Happy Christmas to all... Haven't you been to bed?"</p>
