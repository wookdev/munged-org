title: A Peevetown Parable

At the end of a long hard day, the man did return to that place 
where he lived. Upon his arrival, he felt the need to use the Euphemism, and 
so he did go into the bathroom.

In the white porcelain bathtub the man saw a dark critter with 
six or more legs, which had not been there when he bathed last, at the beginning 
of this long hard day.

The man watched the critter for a time, and wondered how it came 
to be there. It was trapped in the bathtub: it climbed up the side of the tub, 
until it reached that point where its weight overcame its friction against the 
side of the tub, did slide back down to the bottom, and set out again to climb 
up the side of the tub.

The man, tiring of this after several repetitions, tore a strip 
from the bogroll he kept near to the Euphemism, and did place this strip on 
the side of the tub so that the critter could climb to the top upon it.

The critter spied the strip, and instead of climbing upon it, 
did run to the other side of the tub where it resumed its climbing of the wall 
of the tub and sliding down.

Seeing this, the man was disappointed. He then gathered up the 
bogroll strip into a great wad, with which he did smite the critter beyond the 
limits of its exoskeleton. The man did then place wad and critter in the bowl 
of the Euphemism, not as an offering but as refuse, whereupon he relieved himself.

Therefore, if you do go into a place, see that you do not announce 
yourself straightaway, but instead look, and listen, and learn the ways of the 
people in that place, until you are ready to announce yourself in a way that 
will not seem out of place or unwelcome to those people, lest they smite you.

And if it should come to pass that you do announce yourself, 
and find that you are or were not ready, or that you misjudged, be mindful of 
those who offer commentary and advice, and learn from them, even if such advice 
does seem rudely given. Do not turn from them and persist in your course, lest 
they discard you as refuse, and relieve themselves upon you.
