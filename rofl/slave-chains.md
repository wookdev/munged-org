title: Slave Chains

(Sung to: Walking in a Winter Wonderland) </p>

Slave chains ring - Are you listening<br>
In the air - Whips are whistling<br>
What a Beautiful sight<br>
A flogging tonight<br>
Traveling with the slave caravan</p>

Gone away - Is their freedom<br>
We sell them to - Whoever needs them<br>
We'll sing a war song<br>
As we go along<br>
Traveling with the slave caravan</p>

In the morning we will burn the village<br>
We will burn it right down to the ground<br>
First we'll rape the women then we'll pillage<br>
Or maybe it's the other way around (Who cares?)</p>

Later on - We'll conspire<br>
Dividing loot - Around the fire<br>
And we'll face unafraid<br>
The enemies we've made<br>
Traveling with the slave caravan</p>
