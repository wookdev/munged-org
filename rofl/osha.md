### Warning:

The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) 
has determined that the maximum safe load capacity on my ass is 2 persons 
at a time, unless I install handrails or safety straps. As you have 
arrived 6th in line to ride my ass today, please take a number and wait 
your turn!

Thank You
