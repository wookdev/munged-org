title: The Night Before Chanukah
---

'Twas the night before Chanukah, boychicks and maidels<br>
Not a sound could be heard, not even the draidels.<br>
The Menorah was set on the chimney, alight<br>
In the kitchen the Bubba hut gechapt a bite.<br>
Salami, pastrami, a glessala tay<br>
And zayerah pickles with bagels, oy vay!<br>
Gezunt and geschmack, the kinderlech felt<br>
While dreaming of tagelach and Chanukah gelt.

The clock on the mantlepiece away was tickin'<br>
And Bubba was serving a schtickala chicken.<br>
A tumult arose like a thousand brauches,<br>
Santa had fallen and broken his tuches.<br>
I put on my slippers, eins, tsvay, drei,<br>
While Bubba was now on the herring and rye.<br>
I grabbed for my bathrobe and buttoned my gotkes<br>
While Bubba was busy devouring the latkes.</p>

To the window I ran and to my surprise<br>
A little red yarmulka greeted my eyes.<br>
Then he got to the door and saw the Menorah,<br>
"Yiddishe kinder," he said, "Kenehora.<br>
I thought I was in a goyisha hoise,<br>
But as long as I'm here, I'll leave a few toys."</p>

With much gesshray, I asked, "Du bist a Yid?"<br>
"Avada, mein numen is Schloimey Claus, kid."<br>
"Come into the kitchen, I'll get you a dish,<br>
A guppell, a schtickala fish."<br>
With smacks of delight, he started his fressen,<br>
Chopped liver, knaidlach and kreplah gegessen.<br>
Along with his meal, he had a few schnapps,<br>
When it came to eating, this boy was the tops.</p>

He asked for some knishes with pepper and salt,<br>
But they were so hot, he yelled "Oy Gevalt."<br>
Unbuttoning his haizen, he rose from the tisch,<br>
And said, "Your Kosher essen is simply delish."<br>
As he went to the door, he said "I'll see you later,<br>
I'll be back next Pesach, in time for the Seder."</p>

More rapid than eagles his prancers they came,<br>
As he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br>
"Now Izzy, now Morris, now Yitzak, now Sammy,<br>
Now Irving and Maxie, and Moishe and Mannie."<br>
He gave a gesshray as he drove out of sight:<br>
"Gooten Yomtov to all, and to all a good night."</p>
