title: Waka Waka Bang Splat
---

A poll conducted among INFOCUS magazine readers had established 
"waka" as the proper pronunciation for the angle-bracket characters 
<, though some readers held out resolutely for "norkies."

The following poem appeared recently in INFOCUS magazine. The 
original authors were Fred Bremmer and Steve Kroese of Calvin College & 
Seminary of Grand Rapids, MI.

The text of the poem follows:

```
<> !*''#
^"`$$-
!*=@$_
%*<> ~#4
&[]../
|{,,SYSTEM HALTED
```

The poem can only be appreciated by reading it aloud, to wit: 

Waka waka bang splat tick tick hash,<br>
Caret quote back-tick dollar dollar dash,<br>
Bang splat equal at dollar under-score,<br>
Percent splat waka waka tilde number four,<br>
Ampersand bracket bracket dot dot slash,<br>
Vertical-bar curly-bracket comma comma CRASH.
