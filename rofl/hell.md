title: The Week In Hell 
---

A guy dies and wakes up to find he is in hell. He's really depressed 
as he stands in the processing line waiting to talk to an admittance counselor. 
He thinks to himself "I know I lead a wild life but I wasn't that bad. 
I never thought it would come to this." Looking up he sees that it is his 
turn to be processed into hell. With fear and a heavy heart, he walks up to 
the counselor.

 **Counselor:** What's the problem, you look depressed?

**Guy:** Well, what do you think? I am in hell!!!

**Counselor:** Hell isn't so bad, we actually have 
a lot of fun. Do you like to drink?

 **Guy:** Sure, I love to drink.

**Counselor:** Well then, you are going to love 
Mondays. On Mondays we drink up a storm. You can have whiskey, rum, tequila, 
beer, whatever you want and as much as you want. We party all night long. You'll 
love Mondays!!! Do you smoke?

**Guy:** Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

**Counselor:** You are going to love Tuesdays. Tuesday 
is smoke day. You get to smoke the finest cigars and best cigarettes available 
anywhere. And you smoke to your hearts desire without worrying about cancer 
because you are already dead!!! Is that great or what? You are going to love 
Tuesdays!!! Do you do drugs?

**Guy:** Well, in my younger days I experimented 
a little.

**Counselor:** You are going to love Wednesdays. 
That's drug day. You can experiment with any drug you want and you don't have 
to worry about overdoses or getting hooked because you are already dead. You 
are going to love Wednesdays!!! Do you like to gamble?

**Guy:** Yes, I love to gamble.

**Counselor:** You are going to love Thursdays because 
we gamble all day and night -- black jack, craps, poker, slots, horse races, 
everything!!! You are going to love Thursdays!!! Are you gay?

**Guy:** Well, no I am not.

**Counselor:** Ohhhh, you are gonna HATE Fridays!!!
