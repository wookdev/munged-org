title: Twas The Night - Politically Correct
---

'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<br>
How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br>
His workers no longer would answer to "Elves."<br>
"Vertically Challenged" they were calling themselves.<br>
And labor conditions at the North Pole<br>
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.</p>

 Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br>
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br>
And equal employment had made it quite clear<br>
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br>
So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br>
Were replaced with four pigs, and you know that looked stupid!</p>

 The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<br>
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br>
And people had started to call for the cops<br>
When they heard roof noises up on their roof-tops.<br>
Smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br>
His fur-trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."</p>

 And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br>
Rudolf would sue o'er the use of his nose<br>
And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br>
Asking millions of dollars in due compensation.</p>

 So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<br>
Who suddenly said she'd had enough of this life,<br>
Joined a self-helping group, and left in a whiz,<br>
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.</p>

 And as for the gifts, he'd ne'er had a notion<br>
That making a choice could cause such commotion.<br>
Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br>
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br>
Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br>
Nothing to aim and nothing to shoot.<br>
Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br>
Nothing for just girls, or just for the boys.<br>
Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br>
Nothing that's warlike and so, non-pacific.<br>
or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br>
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br>
And fairy tales too, while not yet forbidden,<br>
Were like Ken and Barbie...(just better off hidden.)<br>
For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br>
Who said the only good gift was one ecological.</p>

 No baseball, not football...someone could get hurt;<br>
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to the dirt.<br>
Dolls were too sexist, and should be passe;<br>
And Nintendo, 'twas found, rots your brain cells away.</p>

 So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<br>
He just couldn't figure out what to do next.<br>
He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br>
(But you've got to be careful with that word today.)<br>
His sack was quite empty, lay limp on the ground;<br>
No suitable gift for this year could be found.</p>

 Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br>
Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br>
A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br>
Each group of people and every religion;<br>
Every ethnicity, each color and hue,<br>
Everyone, everywhere...even to you.</p>

 So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br>
May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."</p>
