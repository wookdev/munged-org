title: Burnout Prevention and Recovery (the Microsoft View)
---

1. **STOP DENYING**. Listen to the wisdom of your body. Begin to 
 freely admit the stresses and pressures which have manifested physically, mentally, 
 or emotionally.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Work until the physical pain forces you into 
 unconsciousness.

2. **AVOID ISOLATION**. Don't do everything alone! Develop or renew 
 intimacies with friends and loved ones. Closeness not only brings new insights, 
 but also is anathema to agitation and depression.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Shut your office door and lock it from the 
 inside so no-one will distract you. They're just trying to hurt your productivity.

3. **CHANGE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES**. If your job, your relationships, 
 a situation, or a person is dragging you under, try to alter your circumstances, 
 or if necessary, leave.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: If you feel something is dragging you down, 
 suppress these thoughts. This is a weakness. Drink more coffee. ( It's free.)

4. **DIMINISH INTENSITY IN YOUR LIFE**. Pinpoint those areas or aspects 
 which summon up the most concentrated intensity and work toward alleviating 
 that pressure.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Increase intensity. Maximum intensity = maximum 
 productivity. If you find yourself relaxed and with your mind wandering, you 
 are probably having a detrimental effect on the stock price.

6. **STOP OVERNURTURING**. If you routinely take on other people's 
 problems and responsibilities, learn to gracefully disengage. Try to get some 
 nurturing for yourself.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Always attempt to do everything. You ARE responsible 
 for it all. Perhaps you haven't thoroughly read your job description.

6. **LEARN TO SAY "NO"**. You'll help diminish intensity 
 by speaking up for yourself. This means refusing additional requests or demands 
 on your time or emotions.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Never say no to anything. It shows weakness, 
 and lowers the stock price. Never put off until tomorrow what you can do at 
 midnight.

7. **BEGIN TO BACK OFF AND DETACH**. Learn to delegate, not only 
 at work, but also at home and with friends. In this case, detachment means rescuing 
 yourself for yourself.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Delegating is a sign of weakness. Let someone 
 else do it (See # 5).

8. **REASSESS YOUR VALUES**. Try to sort out the meaningful values 
 from the temporary and fleeting, the essential from the nonessential. You'll 
 conserve energy and time, and begin to feel more centered.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Stop thinking about your own problems. This 
 is selfish. If your values change, we will make an announcement at the company 
 meeting. Until then, if someone calls you and questions your priorities, tell 
 them that you are unable to comment on this and give them the number for Microsoft 
 Marketing. It will be taken care of.

9. **LEARN TO PACE YOURSELF**. Try to take life in moderation. You 
 only have so much energy available. Ascertain what is wanted and needed in your 
 life, then begin to balance work with love, pleasure, and relaxation.

 **MICROSOFT VIEW**: A balanced life is a myth perpetuated by the 
 Borland Marketing Team. Don't be a fool: the only thing that matters is work 
 and productivity.

10. **TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY**. Don't skip meals, abuse yourself 
  with rigid diets, disregard your need for sleep, or break the doctor appointments. 
  Take care of yourself nutritionally.

  **MICROSOFT VIEW**: Your body serves your mind, your mind serves 
  the company. Push the mind and the body will follow. Drink Mountain Dew. (it's 
  free.)

11. **DIMINISH WORRY AND ANXIETY**. Try to keep superstitious worrying 
  to a minimum -- it changes nothing. You'll have a better grip on your situation 
  if you spend less time worrying and more time taking care of your real needs.

  **MICROSOFT VIEW**: If you're not worrying about work, you must 
  not be very committed to it. We'll find someone who is.

12. **KEEP YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR**. Begin to bring joy and happy moments 
  into your life. Very few people suffer burnout when they're having fun.

  **MICROSOFT VIEW**: So, you think your work is funny? We'll discuss 
  this with your manager on Friday. At 7:00 pm.
