title: THE MAN CODE
---

1. Thou shall not rent the movie "Chocolat"
2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella.
3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally 
  killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.
4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, 
  father, priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and 
  should not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. 
  You are permitted to deny his very existence.
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you 
  must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.
6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent 
  without recrimination; beyond that, anyone within earshot is allowed to call 
  BULLSHIT. (Exception: When trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration 
  rate rises to 400 percent)
7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister 
  is off-limits forever - unless you plan to marry her.
8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy 
  who's running late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes 
  for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 babe scale.
9. Complaining about the brand of free beer in a buddies refrigerator 
  is forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable.
10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another 
  man. In fact, even remembering a friends birthday is strictly optional and 
  slightly gay.
11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe that your 
  buddy is trying to hook up with is your legal duty. Should you get carried 
  away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is 
  forbidden to speak of it, even at your bachelor party.
12. Before dating a buddy's "ex", you are required 
  to ask his permission and he in return is required to grant it.
13. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must 
  be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability 
  to pick a buffalo wing clean.
14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem, you didn't 
  see nothin'.
15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move 
  is beer.
16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat. 
17. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you 
  may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's 
  playing.
18. When your girlfriend/wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney 
  friend up with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able 
  to warn your buddy and give him time to prepare excuses about joining the 
  priesthood.
19. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when 
  you're sunning on a tropical beach... and it's delivered by a topless supermodel... 
  and it's free.
20. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.
21. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman 
  must remain sober enough to fight.
22. If a buddy is outnumbered, out manned, or too drunk to fight, 
  you must jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions 
  have caused you to think, "What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin", 
  then you may sit back and enjoy.
23. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight 
  lifting: <br>
  "Yeah, baby, push it!" <br>
  "C'mon, give me one more! Harder!" <br>
  "Another set and we can hit the showers." <br>
  "Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?"
24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice 
  of pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.
25. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring 
  to his beer.
26. Never join your girlfriend/wife in dissing a buddy, except 
  when she's withholding sex pending your response.
27. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal 
  footing: either both urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, 
  a nod is all the conversation you need.
28. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, 
  you may not, unless you are gay.
