One fine day in the middle of the night,<br>
Two dead boys rose up to fight.<br>
One was blind; the other couldn't see.<br>
They chose the devil to be referee.<br>
A blind man went to see fair play<br>
And forty mutes to yell "Hooray."<br>
Back to back they faced each other<br>
Drew their swords and shot one another.<br>
A deaf policeman heard the noise,<br>
Pulled out a knife and shot the boys.<br>
If you don't believe this lie is true,<br>
Ask the blind man; he saw it, too.<br>
He lives on the corner in the middle of the block<br>
In a two-story house on a vacant lot.
