### Computer Errors in Haiku

Everything is gone;<br>
Your life's work has been destroyed.<br>
Squeeze trigger (yes/no)?</p>

I'm sorry, there's -- um --<br>
insufficient -- what's-it-called?<br>
The term eludes me ...</p>

Windows NT crashed.<br>
I am the Blue Screen of Death.<br>
No one hears your screams.</p>

Seeing my great fault<br>
Through darkening blue windows<br>
I begin again</p>

The code was willing,<br>
It considered your request,<br>
But the chips were weak.</p>

A file that big?<br>
It might be very useful.<br>
But now it is gone.</p>

Errors have occurred.<br>
We won't tell you where or why.<br>
Lazy programmers.</p>

Server's poor response<br>
Not quick enough for browser.<br>
Timed out, plum blossom.</p>

Login incorrect.<br>
Only perfect spellers may<br>
enter this system.</p>

wind catches lily<br>
scatt'ring petals to the wind:<br>
segmentation fault</p>

First snow, then silence.<br>
This thousand dollar screen dies<br>
so beautifully.</p>

The Tao that is seen<br>
Is not the true Tao, until<br>
You bring fresh toner.</p>

Yesterday it worked<br>
Today it is not working<br>
Windows is like that</p>

To have no errors<br>
Would be life without meaning<br>
No struggle, no joy</p>

You step in the stream,<br>
but the water has moved on.<br>
This page is not here.</p>

Hal, open the file<br>
Hal, open the damn file, Hal<br>
open the, please Hal</p>

The ten thousand things<br>
How long do any persist?<br>
Netscape, too, has gone.</p>

Serious error.<br>
All shortcuts have disappeared.<br>
Screen. Mind. Both are blank. 

### SPAM Haikus

Blue can of steel<br>
What promise do you hold?<br>
Salt flesh so ripe</p>

Can of metal, slick<br>
Soft center, so cool, moistening<br>
I yearn for your salt</p>

Twist, pull the sharp lid<br>
Jerks and cuts me deeply but<br>
Spam, aah, my poultice</p>

Silent, former pig<br>
One communal awareness<br>
Myriad pink bricks</p>

Clad in metal, proud<br>
No mere salt-curing for you<br>
You are not bacon</p>

And who dares mock Spam?<br>
You? You? You are not worthy<br>
Of one rich pink fleck</p>

Like some spongy rock<br>
A granite, my piece of Spam<br>
In sunlight on my plate</p>

Little slab of meat<br>
In a wash of clear jelly<br>
Now I heat the pan</p>

Oh tin of pink meat<br>
I ponder what you may be:<br>
Snout or ear or feet?</p>

In the cool morning<br>
I fry up a slab of Spam<br>
A dog barks next door</p>

Pink tender morsel<br>
Glistening with salty gel<br>
What the hell is it?</p>

Ears, snouts, and innards<br>
A homogeneous mass<br>
Pass another slice</p>

Old man seeks doctor<br>
"I eat Spam daily," he says<br>
Angioplasty</p>

Highly unnatural<br>
The tortured shape of this "food"<br>
A small pink coffin</p>

Pink beefy temptress<br>
I can no longer remain<br>
Vegetarian</p>
