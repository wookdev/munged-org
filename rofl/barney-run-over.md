title: Barney Got Run Over By A Tractor
---

(Chorus)<br>
Barney got run over by a tractor<br>
Best of all it happened on TV<br>
All the little children are unhappy<br>
I am just beside myself with glee

He was singing to the kiddies <br>
"You Wuv Me and I Wuv You"<br>
Now he is just a piece of roadkill<br>
Some furry purple bits of dino-goo.

Chorus</p>

I don't think the children like me<br>
But though I killed him, it's not wrong<br>
We're saved from evil propaganda<br>
That purple, nazi mind-controller's gone

Chorus</p>

My trial date is set for Tuesday<br>
I won't get off (so I've been told)<br>
10 million kiddies saw me do it<br>
And the judge and jury all are six years old
