title: International Sex
---

In France and Italy, people seduce each other. 

In Brazil, they don't have seduction, they just have sex, and 
are laid back about it in a way many uptight Englanders might find loose-moraled.

In Sweden, they don't have seduction either. Any sex that may 
occur usually happens during a discussion on Third World debt, or the ozone 
layer, or something equally mind-broadening. Any attempt to seduce a Swede will 
result in a patronising lecture on safe sex. 

In Singapore, they don't have seduction either. Ordinary people 
live in towering government-built apartment blocks, most of which have a social 
committee which receives funding from Singapore's government to throw parties 
to get the socially inept technocrats to socialise and marry and have children 
to make more Chinese than Malays and Indians (who have a higher birth rate). 
For the same reason, the National University of Singapore's Engineering faculty 
is built next to the Accounting department, so the male engineers meet the female 
accountants, get married, and have Chinese children.

South of Harlem and north of downtown Manhattan, and either side 
of midtown, is where the rich whites live, and where half the people are too 
busy to even think about something as frivolous as romance, while the other 
half are too busy seeing their shrinks because they can't find romance. Anyone 
they do meet faces a barrage of questions about their career paths, medical 
insurance plans, and past drug and divorce offenses.

People who live in Connecticut and upstate New York, who commute 
to Manhattan every day (so-called "mainline snobs" because they never 
use the subway) seduce each other on the train home, where they scope each other 
out on the train for a few days, then strike up a conversation a couple of minutes 
before one of them gets off (so that if the other person is an asshole, the 
conversation will shortly end anyway) and arrange a lunch date back in Manhattan. 
This ensures that rich professional mainline snobs mix with other rich professionals. 

Near (but not in) Washington D.C., in the neighbouring suburbs 
in Maryland and across the river in Virginia, the first thing single people 
talk about having met an attractive potential partner is politics. Tax-and-spend 
liberals won't go out with Dickensian conservatives, gun nuts won't touch screaming 
heart civil libertarians, lobbiests for oil companies won't date lobbiests for 
clean air, and all the fine shades of political opinion are more important than 
opinions about anything else, physical attractiveness, intellectual prowess, 
and personality. 

In Germany, people can talk about their emotions up-front and 
realistically.

    SCENE:   Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany
    Helmut:  So Hans, how is Helga these days?
    Hans:    Helga says that unless I stop sleeping around
             and spend more time at home, she's going to
             leave me and contest custody of the kids.
    Helmut:  I think Helga has a point - if you really loved
             her, you wouldn't pay for Eva's flat. 
    Hans:    The first few years with Helga were great,
             but I really don't love her any more.

People from other cultures find this Teutonic efficiency a little 
bloodless and dehumanised, as if they discuss their emotions like they discuss 
their shopping list, or desired options in their new Opel. 

In most of Australia, people are afraid to say what they think, 
for fear of offending someone else and for someone else hurting them. Instead, 
they talk about safe trivialities. 

    SCENE:   Kensington, NSW
    Warren:  So Harry, how is Janet these days?
    Harry:   She's been very strange lately. [Tense]
    Warren:  Oh? [Nervous tone of voice]
    Harry:   Yeah.
    Warren:  [Changing the subject]  How's the new Falcon?
    Harry:   It's alright, but typical Australian-made stuff....

Foreigners are shocked to find that the only way to seduce an 
Australian is to pretend to be almost completely disinterested. Any show of 
romantic interest will cause the non-risk-taking Australian to go scurrying 
of to their friends for security. Any effort to be warm, caring, and supportive 
to an Australian woman will cause her to reciprocate only because she thinks 
you must be gay, and thus free of emotional risks.
