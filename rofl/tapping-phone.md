title: Santa Clause is Tapping Your Phone
---

You better watch out,<br>
You better not cry,<br>
You better not pout,<br>
I'm telling you why,<br>
Santa Claus is tapping,<br>
Your phone.

He's buggin your room,<br>
He's reding your mail,<br>
He's keeping a file<br>
And runnin a tail<br>
Santa Claus is tapping<br>
Your phone

 He hears you in the bedroom<br>
Surveills you out of doors<br>
And if that doesn't get the goods<br>
Then he'll use provocateurs.

 So you mustn't assume<br>
That you are secure<br>
On Christmas Eve<br>
He'll kick in your door<br>
Santa Claus is tapping<br>
Your phone
