title: Excerpts from Santa's Corporate Newsletter
---

The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected 
to take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good deal of concern 
about whether they will be replaced, and about other restructuring decisions 
at the North Pole. Streamlining was appropriate in the view that the North Pole 
no longer dominates the season's gift distribution business.</p>

Home shopping channels and mail order catalogues have diminished 
Santa's market share and he could not sit idly by and permit further erosion 
of the profit picture.</p>

The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase 
of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip. Improved productivity 
from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard Business School, is anticipated 
and should take up the slack with no discernible loss in service. Reduction 
in reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for which the 
North Pole has been cited and received unfavorable press.</p>

I am pleased to inform you and yours that Rudolph's role will 
not be disturbed. Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. Management 
denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak that Rudolph's 
nose got that way not from the cold but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph 
"a lush who was into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load" 
was an unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa's helpers and taken out of 
context at a time of year when he is known to be under executive stress.</p>

As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require 
the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive steps. Effective 
immediately, the following economy measures are to take place in the "Twelve 
Days of Christmas" subsidiary"</p>

The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned 
out to be the cash crop forcasted. It will be replace by a plastic hanging plant, 
providing considerable savings in maintenance.</p>

The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not 
cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be 
condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated.</p>

The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone 
loves the French.</p>

The four calling birds were replace by an automated voice mail 
system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who 
the birds have been calling, how and how long they talked.</p>

The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of 
Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative 
implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious 
metals as well as a mix of T-bills and high technology stocks appears to be 
in order.</p>

The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer 
be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose 
is an example of the decline of productivity. Three geese will be let go, and 
an upgrading in he selection procedure will assure management that from now 
on every goose it gets will be a good one.</p>

The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better 
times. Their function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. 
The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes and therefore 
enhance their outplacment.</p>

As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under 
heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being 
sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward 
mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring 
or a-mulching.</p>

Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function 
will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the 
steps.</p>

Ten lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords plus 
the expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation Committee 
to suggest replacing this group with ten out of work congressmen. While the 
leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant because 
we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year.</p>

Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple 
case of the band getting too big. A substitution of a string quartet, a cutback 
on new music, and no uniforms will produce savings which will drop right to 
the bottom line.</p>

We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, 
animals and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching 
deliveries over twelve days in inefficient. If we can drop ship in one day, 
service will be improved.</p>

Regarding the lawsuit file by the attorney's association seeking 
expansion to include the legal profession ("thirteen lawyers-a-suing"), 
action is pending.</p>

Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be 
necessary in the future to stay competitive. Should that happen, the Board will 
request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven dwarves 
is the right number.</p>
