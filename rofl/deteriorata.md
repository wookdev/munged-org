title: Deteriorata
---

Go placidly amid the noise and waste, and remember what comfort 
there may be in owning a piece thereof. Avoid quiet and passive persons unless 
you are in need of sleep. Rotate your tires. Speak glowingly of those greater 
than yourself and heed well their advice, even though they be turkeys; know 
what to kiss and when. Consider that two wrongs never make a right, but that 
three do. Wherever possible, put people on hold. Be comforted that in the face 
of all aridity and disillusionment and despite the changing fortunes of time, 
there will always be a big future in computer maintenance. Remember the Pueblo. 
Strive at all times to bend, fold, spindle, and mutilate. Know yourself; if 
you need help, call the FBI. Exercise caution in your daily affairs, especially 
with those persons closest to you. That lemon on your left, for instance. Be 
assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls would scarcely get your 
feet wet. Fall not in love therefore; it will stick to your face. Gracefully 
surrender the things of youth, birds, clean air, tuna, Taiwan; and let not the 
sands of time get in your lunch. Hire people with hooks. For a good time, call 
606-4311; ask for Ken. Take heart amid the deepening gloom that your dog is 
finally getting enough cheese; and reflect that whatever misfortune may be your 
lot, it could only be worse in Milwaukee. You are a fluke of the universe; you 
have no right to be here, and whether you can hear it or not, the universe is 
laughing behind your back. Therefore make peace with your God whatever you conceive 
Him to be: Hairy Thunderer, or Cosmic Muffin. With all its hopes, dreams, promises, 
and urban renewal, the world continues to deteriorate. Give up.</p>
