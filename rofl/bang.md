title: Save the '!'
---

The International Typographer's Association has announced an impending shortage 
of exclamation marks (sometimes affectionately known as "bangs"). These 
poor, put-upon points of punctuation have been overworked in too many pieces 
of prose and programming alike, causing the previously plentiful population 
to diminish perilously.

All writers of C code and other works of art are asked to help avert the oncoming 
crisis by substituting other symbols for the exclamation mark. In C, this can 
be done by using the word NOT instead. To illustrate, we'll have to sacrifice 
just a few of the brave creatures:

  if (! a)		/* Old */

becomes:

  if (NOT a)		/* New */

In fact, since this works so well in C, it can be carried over to English as 
well. Rather than obscuring the meaning of many sentences, it can help make 
them even more accurate. For example:

> The Windigent OS release 42 offers much higher performance and better portability
> than any other operating system!

becomes:

> The Windigent OS release 42 offers much higher performance and better portability 
> than any other operating system NOT

Please start using this system today NOT With your help, we can help save our 
precious bangs for future generations NOT</p>
