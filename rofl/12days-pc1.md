title: THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS (p.c. version)
---
On the 12th day of the Eurocentrically imposed midwinter festival,
my potential-acquaintance-abuse-survivor gave to me,

**TWELVE** males reclaiming their inner warrior through ritual drumming.

**ELEVEN** pipers piping (plus the 18-member pit orchestra
made up of members in good standing of the Musicians Equity Union as called
for in their union contract even though they will not be asked to play a note...)

**TEN** melanin-deprived testosterone-poisoned scions of the
patriarchal ruling class system leaping,

**NINE** persons engaged in rhythmic self-expression,

**EIGHT** economically disadvantaged female persons stealing
milk-products from enslaved Bovine-Americans,

**SEVEN** endangered swans swimming on federally protected
wetlands,

**SIX** enslaved fowl-Americans producing stolen nonhuman
animal products,

**FIVE** golden symbols of culturally sanctioned enforced
domestic incarceration,

(NOTE: after a member of the Animal Liberation Front threatened
to throw red paint at my computer, the calling birds, French hens and partridge
have been reintroduced to their native habitat. To avoid further animal-American
enslavement, the remaining gift package has been revised.)

**FOUR** hours of recorded whale songs,

**THREE** deconstructionist poets,

**TWO** Sierra Club calendars printed on recycled processed tree carcasses,

and a Spotted Owl activist chained to an old-growth pear tree.
