title: 25 Different Ways to Get Your Roommate to Bug Off
---

1. Get him laid. That's what he really needs. He will stop paying 
attention to you and pay attention to someone else.</p>

2. Use the direct approach. When he comes in, say, "I'm 
doing homework now. Can I talk to you later?." If that's too polite, say 
"Go away now. I'm doing homework."</p>

3. Use the "bad cat" approach. Purchase a high-powered 
squirt gun. Whenever he does something like that, say "I'm doing my homework. 
Anyone interrupting me will be wet." Then, blast away. He's been warned. 
I've discovered that this is an excellent way to keep my cat from scratching 
the furniture. I yelled at him and moved him until I realized that he was doing 
it for attention. After I squirted him three different times, he stopped permanently. 
Use a squirt bottle if the gun is too silly.</p>

4. Buy a monster stereo and some tapes of the Sex Pistols, the 
Misfits, the BeeGees, and Barry Manilow. Turn it on and play it really loud 
when you don't want to be interrupted.</p>

5. Set a small bear trap near the door. Cover it with a towel.</p>

6. Bring over your girlfriend. Do what comes naturally, but make 
it loud. Record this. Play that on your monster stereo.</p>

7. Whenever he comes in, give him a strange look, then climb 
out the window. Come back around to the front door and re-enter your room. Repeat 
as necessary. If he asks any questions, just say,"It's too cold in here!"</p>

8. Masturbate.</p>

9. If he's a Democrat, put up big pictures of Ronald Reagan. 
If he's Republican, use Michael Dukakis. Intersperse either with posters of 
Margaret Thatcher.</p>

10. Smoke.</p>

11. Buy a book on Black Magic. Put a hex on him if he gets too 
close.</p>

12. Get a guard dog. Rottweilers and Doberman Pincers are good.</p>

13. Buy two monster stereos. Play different music (see #4) from 
each--at the same time.</p>

14. Give him a haircut.</p>

15. Start asking him to help you with the homework.</p>

16. Ask him for the password. If he doesn't know it, don't let 
him in.</p>

17. Get a doorknob with a lock on it. Put it on your door to 
lock him out, or his door to lock him in.</p>

18. Lie in the middle of the floor and play dead.</p>

19. Get a pet rattlesnake. Let it loose once in awhile.</p>

20. Start a used chewing gum collection. Show him your favorite 
exhibits whenever he come in.</p>

21. Ignore him completely. Pretend you can't see or hear him 
at all.</p>

22. Challenge him to see if he can hold his breath for two minutes. 
Use the squirt gun if he fails.</p>

23. Give him a "whirly."</p>

24. Refer to him as "Marsha." If he asks why, refuse 
to explain.</p>

And, since this IS alt.flame.roommate....</p>

25. Kill him. Cyanide works well.</p>
