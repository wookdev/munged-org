[ Wook: As a road warrior you get used to playing by all 
the rules of traveling by air. After a while it becomes a game to get the best 
deal for the lowest price, and you develop a list of tricks to get what you 
want most of the time. This practice falls into the category of "defense 
mechanism" after a while, because it goes towards alleviating some of the 
stress of being on the road. However, it is still a very silly game we play, 
and very silly rules we play them by.</span>

But sometimes you have to get something like this in your 
email to point out just how silly it really is.]

### BUYING PAINT FROM A HARDWARE STORE

**Customer:** Hi. How much is your paint?

**Clerk:** We have regular quality for $12 a gallon and premium 
for $18. How many gallons would you like?

**Customer:** Five gallons of regular quality, please.

**Clerk:** Great. That will be $60 plus tax.

### BUYING PAINT FROM AN AIRLINE

**Customer:** Hi, how much is your paint?

**Clerk:** Well, sir, that all depends.

**Customer:** Depends on what?

**Clerk:** Actually, a lot of things.

**Customer:** How about giving me an average price?

**Clerk:** Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is 
$9 a gallon, and we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon.

**Customer:** What's the difference in the paint?

**Clerk:** Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

**Customer:** Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.

**Clerk:** Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do 
you intend to use it?

**Customer:** I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.

**Clerk:** Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

**Customer:** What? When would I have to paint in order to get the 
$9 version?

**Clerk:** That would be in three weeks, but you will also have 
to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting 
until at least Sunday.

**Customer:** You've got to be kidding!

**Clerk:** Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to 
check to see if we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to 
you.

**Customer:** What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to 
me? You have shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.

**Clerk:** Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have 
it. It may be the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on 
any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.

**Customer:** You mean the price went up while we were talking!

**Clerk:** Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands 
of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with 
your paint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to 
happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons 
do you want?

**Customer:** I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe 
I should buy six gallons just to make sure I have enough.

 **Clerk:** Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the 
paint and then don't use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation 
of the paint you already have.

**Customer:** What?

**Clerk:** That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your 
kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you 
do the bedroom, you will be in violation of our tariffs.

**Customer:** But what does it matter to you whether I use all the 
paint? I already paid you for it!

**Clerk:** Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the 
way it is. We make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, 
and when you don't, it just causes us all sorts of problems.

**Customer:** This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen 
if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!

**Clerk:** Yes, sir, it will.

**Customer:** Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy 
my paint.

**Clerk:** That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same 
rules. Thanks for painting with our airline.
