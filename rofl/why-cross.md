title: Why Did The Chicken Cross the Road?
---

The Sphinx:<br>
You tell me. 

Buddha:<br>
If you ask this question, you deny your own chicken-nature.

Hippocrates:<br>
Because of an excess of light pink gooey stuff in its pancreas.

Epicurus:<br>
For fun.

Pyrrho the Skeptic:<br>
What road?

Plato:<br>
For the greater good.

Aristotle:<br>
To actualize its potential.

Machiavelli:<br>
So that its subjects will view it with admiration, as a chicken which has the 
daring and courage to boldly cross the road, but also with fear, for whom among 
them has the strength to contend with such a paragon of avian virtue? In such 
a manner is the princely chicken's dominion maintained.

Tomas de Torquemada:<br>
Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I'll find out.

Nietzsche:<br>
Because if you gaze too long across the Road, the Road gazes also across you.

Johann Friedrich von Goethe:<br>
The eternal hen-principle made it do it.

Ralph Waldo Emerson:<br>
It didn't cross the road; it transcended it.

Henry David Thoreau:<br>
To live deliberately ... and suck all the marrow out of life.

Mark Twain:<br>
The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated.

Karl Marx:<br>
It was a historical inevitability.

Carl Jung:<br>
The confluence of events in the cultural gestalt necessitated that individual 
chickens cross roads at this historical juncture, and therefore synchronicitously 
brought such occurrences into being.

Jean-Paul Sartre:<br>
In order to act in good faith and be true to itself, the chicken found it necessary 
to cross the road.

Ludwig Wittgenstein:<br>
The possibility of "crossing" was encoded into the objects "chicken" 
and"road," and circumstances came into being which caused the actualization 
of this potential occurrence.

David Hume:<br>
Out of custom and habit.

Ernest Hemingway:<br>
To die. In the rain.

Emily Dickinson:<br>
Because it could not stop for death.

Joseph Stalin:<br>
I don't care. Catch it. I need its eggs to make my omelet.

Albert Einstein:<br>
Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road crossed the chicken depends 
upon your frame of reference.

Werner Heisenberg:<br>
We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was on, but it was moving 
very fast.

Timothy Leary:<br>
Because that's the only kind of trip the Establishment would let it take.

Salvador Dali:<br>
The Fish.

Douglas Adams:<br>
Forty-two.

Stephen Jay Gould:<br>
It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation for it, but we have 
been deluged in recent years with sociobiological stories despite the fact that 
we have little direct evidence about the genetics of behavior, and we do not 
know how to obtain it for the specific behaviors that figure most prominently 
in sociobiological speculation.

Oliver North:<br>
National Security was at stake.

Ronald Reagan:<br>
I forget.

John Sununu:<br>
The Air Force was only too happy to provide the transportation, so quite understandably 
the chicken availed himself of the opportunity.

Jack Nicholson:<br>
'Cause it f*cking wanted to. That's the f*cking reason.

Saddam Hussein:<br>
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion, and we were quite justified in dropping 
50 tons of nerve gas on it.

Andersen Consultant:<br>
Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its dominant 
market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create 
and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen 
Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken 
by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. 
Using the Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its 
skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken's 
people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a 
Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum 
of road analysts and best chickens along with Andersen consultants with deep 
skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings 
in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, 
and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit 
goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide 
value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The 
meeting was held in a park-like setting enabling and creating an impactful environment 
which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, 
clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, 
and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business 
integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken change to become 
more successful.
