### How to Tell When Foodstuffs Should Be Discarded </p>

**THE GAG TEST**

Anything that makes you gag is spoiled except for leftovers from what you cooked 
for yourself last night.</p>

**EGGS**

When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably 
past its prime.</p>

**DAIRY PRODUCTS**

Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yogurt. Yogurt is spoiled when it 
starts to look like cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts 
to look like regular cheese. Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway 
and can't get any more spoiled than it is already.</p>

**MAYONNAISE**

If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, mayonnaise is spoiled.</p>

**FROZEN FOODS**

Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in 
your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled-- or wrecked, anyway-- by 
the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife.</p>

**MEAT**

If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius 
to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled.</p>

**LETTUCE**

Bibb lettuce is spoiled when you can't get it off the bottom of the vegetable 
crisper without Comet.</p>

**CANNED GOODS**

Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a basketball should be 
disposed of. Carefully.</p>

**CARROTS**

A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh.</p>

**WINE**

It should not taste like salad dressing.</p>

**POTATOES**

Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth.</p>

**CHIP DIP**

If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone 
bad.</p>

**GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:**

Most food cannot be kept longer than the average lifespan of a hamster. Keep 
a hamster in your refrigerator to gauge this.
