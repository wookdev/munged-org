title: The Night Before Christmas......
---

'Twas the night before Christmas, an all through the block,<br>
Not a creature was stirring, not even Ed Kotch.<br>
The stockings were hung, by the furnace with care.<br>
In hopes that by morning, they'd all still be there.</p>
 
Me an this skank, were just getting ready for bed.<br>
I wore pajamas, she had a paper bag for her head.<br>
When up on the roof, I heard a big crash,<br>
I thought it was a burglar, I was gonna kick ass!</p>
 
I went out on the fire escape, looked up in the sky,<br>
An what did I see, but this freakin fat guy!<br>
With a red suit and boots, that came up to his knees,<br>
In the moonlight he looked, just like Dom DeLouise.</p>
 
He had a big sled, being pulled by reindeer.<br>
He called one of them Dancer, so I assumed he was queer.<br>
As he crept off the roof, it became clear to me,<br>
That this guy was lookin, to steal my TV!</p>
 
Over his shoulder, he had a big sack.<br>
He came down the stairs, while I planned my attack.<br>
I waited a second, till the time it seemed ripe.<br>
Bopped him on the head, * botta bing * with a pipe!</p>
 
He fell to the floor, with a groan and a thud.<br>
I was kinda surprised, that I didn't see blood.<br>
Instead he rolled over, looked me in the eye.<br>
When I saw who I'd hit, I near started to cry.</p>
 
I said "hey 'yo Santa, I'm sorry all right?"<br>
"Not for nuttin" he said, "but this just ain't my night!"<br>
"I got lost in the Bronx, ran over some Nuns."<br>
"Had a near miss by Kennedy, Rudolf's got the runs..."</p>
 
"I'm out all freakin night, I'm bustin my hump."<br>
"But I can't finish now, not with this lump!"<br>
"So do me a favor, and be a real pal."<br>
"Take over for me...be Santa Sal."</p>
 
I say 'Yo! I'm from Brooklyn, I ain't right for the part.<br>
But he says that Santa Claus, comes from the heart.<br>
He made me a offer, I could'nt refuse.<br>
Stop at every house....except for the Jews!</p>
 
I got into the suit, jumped onto the sleigh,<br>
Wondering just why it was, reindeer smelled that way.<br>
Took off on my mission, didn't want to be late.<br>
While old Nick spent the night, hosin' my date.</p>
 
That night I was Santa, bringing kids joy and bliss.<br>
And if you don't believe that...hey, jingle dis!<br>
Since then I been with him, each year in the cold.<br>
Riding shotgun with Santa, 'cause he's fat, and he's old.</p>
 
I'm his number one helper, I been deputized.<br>
So on this Christmas Eve, don't you be surprised.<br>
If you hear a voice say, real loud and abrupt.<br>
"Merry Christmas to all, thanks alot...shutup!"</p>
