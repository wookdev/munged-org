title: Take This Job and... Shove [me into] it!

Dear [Interviewer's Name]:

Thank you for your letter of [Date]. After careful consideration 
I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me employment 
with your firm. This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an 
unusually large number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising 
field of candidates it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.

Despite Acme Inc.'s outstanding qualifications and previous 
experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet 
with my needs at this time. Therefore, I will initiate employment with your 
firm immediately following graduation. I look forward to seeing you then.

Best of luck in rejecting future candidates.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
