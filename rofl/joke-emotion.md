title: Emotion Theme Party
---
 
A man decides to have a party and invites lots of people, telling them to bring 
their friends. On the invitation he puts Theme Party - Come as a Human Emotion.</p>

On the night of the party, the first guest arrives and he opens the door to 
see a guy covered in green paint with the letters N and V painted on his chest. 

He says to this guy, "Wow, great outfit, what emotion have you come as?" 

And the guy says, "I'm green with envy."</p>

The host replies, "Brilliant, come on in and have a drink."</p>

A few minutes later the next guest arrives and the host opens the door to see 
a woman covered in a pink body stocking with a feather boa wrapped around her 
most intimate parts. He says to this woman, "Wow, great outfit, what emotion 
have you come as?"

She replies, "I'm tickled pink."

The host says, "I love it, come on in and join the party."

A couple of minutes later the doorbell goes for the third time, and the host 
opens the door to see two guys from New York, stark naked, one with his penis 
stuck in a bowl of custard and the other with his penis stuck in a pear.

The host is really shocked and says, "Christ Guys! You could get arrested 
for standing like that out here in the street. What emotion is this supposed 
to be?"

The first guy replies, "Well, I'm fuckin discustid, and my friend here 
has come in dispair".
