title: Twas the night after xmas
---

By Lorraine Metivier 

Twas the nite after christmas and all through the house<br>
Was a wall to wall mess, no room for a mouse.

The new toys are scattered, in every wich way.<br>
Trains, dolls and games, just everything to play.

The stockings that were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
are now on the floor, and full of dog hair.

The dear little children, from short ones to tall,<br>
This day are fed pepto-Bismal

For their tummies are stuffed with all kinds of things.<br>
Like candy and peanuts and pineapple rings.

The children are cranking from not enough sleep.<br>
They fight over toys, two boys and one jeep.

Timmy can't find the wheels to his small model car<br>
How on earth did they get in the baby food jar?

Sis is still crying, here eyes are all red.<br>
Our puppy has chewed off her Barbi Dolls head.

Poor mom is trying to vacume and broom.<br>
To organize the house, or at least just one room.

And dad with his tools, grunts and just trembles<br>
he gets madder and madder with each toy he assembles.

Just when Mom and Dad try to sit down to relax.<br>
Here comes more company, Aunt Flo and Uncle Max.

Dad has a drink with them, just to be polite<br>
Like he did with the others, how many tonight?

Poor Dad's got a headache, his eyes are all red.<br>
He sure does look funny, with the lampshade on his head.

They all settle down, from puppy to dad.<br>
The children thank the lord for the Christmas they had.

Twas the nite after Christmas in their beds they all lay.<br>
They must get their rest, to face New Years Day!
