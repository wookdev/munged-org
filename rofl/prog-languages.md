title: Programmer's Quick Guide to Languages
---
 

The proliferation of modern programming languages (all of which 
seem to have stolen countless features from one another) sometimes makes it 
difficult to remember what language you're currently using. This handy reference 
is offered as a public service to help programmers who find themselves in such 
a dilemma.</p>

** TASK:** Shoot yourself in the foot

**C:** You shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

**C++:** You accidentally create a dozen instances 
of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance 
is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just 
pointing at others and saying, "That's me, over there."</p>

**FORTRAN:** You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, 
until you run out of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you 
run out of bullets, you continue with the attempts to shoot yourself anyways 
because you have no exception-handling capability.</p>

**Pascal:** The compiler won't let you shoot yourself 
in the foot.</p>

**Ada:** After correctly packing your foot, you 
attempt to concurrently load the gun, pull the trigger, scream, and shoot yourself 
in the foot. When you try, however, you discover you can't because your foot 
is of the wrong type.</p>

**COBOL:** Using a COLT 45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at LEG.FOOT, 
THEN place ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER and SQUEEZE. THEN return HANDGUN 
to HOLSTER. CHECK whether shoelace needs to be re-tied.</p>

**LISP:** You shoot yourself in the appendage which 
holds the gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the 
gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with 
which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you 
shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot yourself 
in the appendage which holds...</p>

**FORTH:** Foot in yourself shoot.</p>

**Prolog:** You tell your program that you want 
to be shot in the foot. The program figures out how to do it, but the syntax 
doesn't permit it to explain it to you.</p>

**BASIC:** Shoot yourself in the foot with a water 
pistol. On large systems, continue until entire lower body is waterlogged.</p>

**Visual Basic:** You'll really only _appear_ to 
have shot yourself in the foot, but you'll have had so much fun doing it that 
you won't care.</p>

**HyperTalk:** Put the first bullet of gun into 
foot left of leg of you. Answer the result.</p>

**Motif:** You spend days writing a UIL description 
of your foot, the bullet, its trajectory, and the intricate scrollwork on the 
ivory handles of the gun. When you finally get around to pulling the trigger, 
the gun jams.</p>

**APL:** You shoot yourself in the foot, then spend 
all day figuring out how to do it in fewer characters.</p>

**SNOBOL:** If you succeed, shoot yourself in the 
left foot. If you fail, shoot yourself in the right foot.</p>

**Unix**:

```
% ls
foot.c foot.h foot.o toe.c toe.o
% rm * .o
rm:.o no such file or directory
% ls
% 
```

**Concurrent Euclid:** You shoot yourself in somebody else's foot.</p>

**370 JCL:** You send your foot down to MIS and 
include a 400-page document explaining exactly how you want it to be shot. Three 
years later, your foot comes back deep-fried.</p>

**Paradox:** Not only can you shoot yourself in 
the foot, your users can, too.</p>

**Access:** You try to point the gun at your foot, 
but it shoots holes in all your Borland distribution diskettes instead.</p>

**Revelation:** You're sure you're going to be able 
to shoot yourself in the foot, just as soon as you figure out what all these 
nifty little bullet-thingies are for.</p>

**Assembler:** You try to shoot yourself in the 
foot, only to discover you must first invent the gun, the bullet, the trigger, 
and your foot.</p>

**Modula2:** After realizing that you can't actually 
accomplish anything in this language, you shoot yourself in the head.</p>
