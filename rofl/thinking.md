title: TA - Thinkers Anonymous
---

It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties 
now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and 
soon I was more than just a social thinker.</p>

I began to think alone - "to relax," I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true.</p>

Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I 
was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking 
and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.</p>

I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau 
and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, "What 
is it exactly we are doing here?"</p>

Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had 
turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that 
night at her mother's.</p>

I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss 
called me in. He said, " I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your 
thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll 
have to find another job."</p>

This gave me a lot to think about.</p>

I came home early after my conversation with the boss. "Honey," 
I confessed, "I've been thinking..."</p>

"I know you've been thinking," she said, "and I want a divorce!"</p>

"But Honey, surely it's not that serious."</p>

"It is serious," she said, lower lip aquiver.</p>

"You think as much as college professors, and college professors 
don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"</p>

"That's a faulty syllogism," I said impatiently, and 
she began to cry. I'd had enough. "I'm going to the library," I snarled 
as I stomped out the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche. 
I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't 
open. The library was closed. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling 
glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. "Friend, is 
heavy thinking ruining your life?" it asked. You probably recognize that 
line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster.</p>

Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never 
miss a TA meeting.</p>

At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it 
was "Porky's."</p>

Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since 
the last meeting. I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. 
Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>
