title: Tired and Complaining

The following is an actual letter of complaint which I grabbed off the net 
many years ago (when it used to be called net.jokes, if you can remember that 
long ago!) Unfortunately, I don't have the original source anymore.

Note the date sent and the prices quoted.

Atlanta, Georgia<br>
September 13, 1970</p>

Director<br>
Billing Department<br>
Shell Oil Company<br>
P.O. Box XXXX<br>
Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102

Dear Sir:

I have been a regular customer of the Shell Oil Company for several years now, 
and spend approximately $40.00 per month on Shell products. Until recently, 
I have been completely satisfied with the quality of Shell products and with 
the service of Shell employees. </p>

Included in my most recent statement from your department was a bill for $12.00 
for a tire which I purchased at the Lowell I. Reels Shell station in McAdenville, 
N.C. I stopped at this station for gasoline and to have a timing malfunction 
corrected. The gasoline cost $5.15; eight new plugs cost $9.36; labor on the 
points $2.50. All well and good. </p>

Earlier in the day I had a flat tire, which the attendant at the Lowell I. 
Reels station informed me that he was unable to fix. He suggested that I purchase 
a tire from him in order that I have a spare for the remainder of my journey 
to Atlanta. I told him that I preferred to buy tires from home station in Atlanta, 
but he continued to stress the risk of driving without a spare. My reluctance 
to trade with an unknown dealer, even a Shell dealer, did not discourage him 
and finally, as I was leaving, he said that out of concern for my safety (my 
spare was not new) and because I had made a substantial expenditure at his station, 
he would make me a special deal. He produced a tire ("Hits a good one. 
Still has the tits on it. See them tits. Hits a twenty dollar tar.") which 
I purchased for twelve dollars and which he installed on the front left side 
for sixty-five cents. Fifty miles further down the highway, I had a blowout.

Not a puncture which brought a slow, flapping flat, nor a polite ladyfinger 
firecracker rubberburpple rupture (pop); but a howitzer blowout, which reared 
the the hood of my car up into my face, a blowout, sir, which tore a flap of 
rubber from this "tire" large enough to make soles for both sandals 
of a medium sized hippie. In a twinkling, then, I was driving down Interstate 
85 at sixty miles per hour on three tires and one rim with rubber clinging to 
it in desperate shreds and patches, an instrument with a bent, revolving, steel-then-rubber-then-steel 
rim, whose sound can be approximated by the simultaneous placing of a handful 
of gravel and a young duck into a Waring Blender. </p>

The word "careen" does no justice whatever to the movement that the 
car then performed. According to the highway patrolman's report, the driver 
in the adjoining lane, the left hand-- who, incidentally, was attempting to 
pass me at the time-- ejaculated adrenelin all over the ceiling of his car. 
My own passengers were fused into a featureless quiver in the key of "G" 
in the back seat of my car. The rim was bent; the tits were gone; and you can 
f--k yourself with a cream cheese dildo if you entertain for one moment the 
delusion that I intend to pay the twelve dollars. </p>

Sincerely yours, </p>

/s/ T.B.T. </p>
