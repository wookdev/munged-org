title: Ode to a Martini Drinker
---

Starkle, starkle, little twink,<br>
Who the hell you are I think,<br>
I'm not under what they call<br>
The alcofluence of incohol.<br>
I'm not drunk as thinkle peep,<br>
I'm just a little slort of sheep.<br>
Tee martoonis make a guy<br>
Fool so feelish, don't know why<br>
Rally don't know who's me yet<br>
The drunker I stay the longer I get<br>
So just one more to full my cup,<br>
I've all day sober to Sunday up.
