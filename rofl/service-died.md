title: The Day the Service Died
---

( to the tune of, "American Pie" )


A long, long time ago,<br>
I can still remember when I dialed up their help desk lines.<br>
And I knew if I had the chance, they could make my modem dance with chats and 
GIFs and silly<br>
pick-up lines.</p>

But, Help Desk phone calls made me shiver with every busy they'd deliver.</p>

Bad news on the front page,<br>
A 19-hour outrage.</p>

I can't remember if I cried when I realized that Steve Case had lied.</p>

But something touched me deep inside,<br>
The day, the ser-vice died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

Did you write the book of TOS,<br>
Will you send your password to PWD-BOSS if an IM tells you so.</p>

And will you believe the Motley Fool when he tells you that the service rules,<br>
And, can you teach me how to web real slow?</p>

Well, I know you sold the service short,<br>
'Cause I saw your quarterly report.</p>

Steve Case sold off his stock,<br>
It fell just like a rock.</p>

It was a crazy, costly high-tech play, as they slashed away at what subscribers pay,<br>
And half their users went away, the day the service died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

Well for two days we've been on our own<br>
And dial-ins click on a rolling phone<br>
But that's not how it used to be,<br>
When the mogul came to Virginia court, With an OS icon and a browser port,<br>
And a desktop that looked like Apple III.</p>

And while Jim Clark was looking down,<br>
The mogul stole his thorny crown,<br>
The browser war was turned,<br>
Mozilla,... was spurned.</p>

And while Steve left users out to bond,<br>
With hosts unable to respond,<br>
6 million newbies all were conned,<br>
The day the service died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

Da Chronic ducked their software guards,<br>
And stole a million credit cards, to use accounts he'd gotten free.</p>

And so Steve Case went to the FBI,<br>
and he told Boardwatch* a little lie,<br>
That hackers wanted child pornography *<br>
But while Steve Case was looking down,<br>
The hackers pulled his e-mail down,<br>
They put it on the net,<br>
He can't be trusted, yet!</p>

And while user cynicism climbs,<br>
At sign-on ads and welcome rhymes, they scan their e-mail for, "Good Times,"<br>
The day the ser-vice died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

Helter-skelter billing needs a melter,<br>
The lawyers filed a class-action shelter,<br>
Eight million in lawyer's fees.</p>

But it looks like some attorney jibe,<br>
an hour if they resubscribe,<br>
To a service marketed for free.</p>

Well, I know you're raking in the bucks,<br>
'Cause I'm reading alt.aol-sucks.</p>

"Until we bless the suit,<br>
The settlement is moot."</p>

"If AOL treats you like the Borg,<br>
Then visit aolsucks.org,<br>
Before some router pulls the cord,..."<br>
The day the ser-vice died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

Bill Razzouk, the head-to-be,<br>
sold off his home in Tennessee,<br>
And headed for a 4-month end.</p>

Was he sad or just incensed when Case offered him his thirty cents.<br>
Billing is the devil's only friend.</p>

But as I read him on the page,<br>
My hands were clenched in fists of rage,<br>
No, "Welcome" born in hell, could ring that chatroom bell.</p>

And as chat freaks cried into the night, CompuServe read their last rites.<br>
I saw Earthlink laughing with delight, The day the ser-vice died.</p>

So, Bye-Bye to Amer'ca Online,<br>
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br>
And good old geeks are cheering users offline.<br>
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br>
This'll be the day that they die.</p>

I met a girl in Lobby 9,<br>
And I asked her if she'd stay online,<br>
But she just frowned and looked away,</p>

And I went back to the Member Lounge, To see what loyalty I could scrounge.<br>
But Room Host said the members went away,...</p>

And on the net the modems screamed,<br>
At faster bits and data streams.</p>

And not a tear was spoken,<br>
The hourly fees were broken,</p>

And the three men that I hated most: Ted, and Steve, and Razzouk's ghost,<br>
They couldn't dial up the host,<br>
The day the ser-vice died.
