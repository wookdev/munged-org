title: A Networkologist's Christmas (v3.1)
---

Tis the night before Christmas," I thought with a frown.<br>
I was stuck at the office. The network was down.<br>
The routers were hung in the closet. All crashed. <br>
Their tables had holes in their data. All trashed. <br>
Remote distribution, it seems, just for fun,<br>
Had erased DLLs Windows needed to run <br>
On 84 desktops way down in accounting.<br>
I sat stunned at my desk. my blood pressure mounting. 

When all of a sudden there arose such a clatter, <br>
I saw that a server had something the matter.<br>
There was smoke coming out of the main hard disk drive. <br>
"No problem, " I thought. "I'm set up with RAID 5. " <br>
But I found out the system I thought was unstoppable <br>
Had disk drives that turned out completely unswappable! <br>
"No problem," I thought. "I've tape backup to thank. <br>
And then I discovered my backups were blank.

The UPS burped, and its lights all went out. <br>
I started to scream! I started to shout! <br>
But nobody heard as I vented my rage.<br>
My gurus were all on vacation those days.<br>
And nobody's tech support answered the phone. <br>
I was nose deep in trouble, completely alone. <br>
When out at reception, I heard a soft knock.<br>
As the hands just touched midnight on my desktop <br>
clock...

"What's your problem?" he asked.<br>
"Never mind, friend, I know.<br>
I checked out your network five hours ago. <br>
I did some proactive analysis, so<br>
I knew that this time bomb was going to blow. <br>
Who was this guy? Who did he think that he was?<br>
He was dressed in red coveralls, white beard, black <br>
gloves.

His eyes had the twinkle of technical genius. <br>
His smile cut down personal distance between us.<br>
He spread out his tools, and went straight to his work. <br>
"Whoever configured this network's a jerk,'<br>
He said with a :-)&gt; as he quickly rebooted, <br>
Uploaded some software, and smoothly rerouted <br>
The LAN to a WAN that he quickly supplied <br>
With bandwidth at least 20 gigabits wide<br>
That went via wireless, I think, LEO,<br>
To tech support elves waiting at the North Pole.

"Now bridging, now routing, now Ethernet hubs!' <br>
He chanted as each piece of hardware he rubbed.<br>
"Cheer up, my good friend! Lose that mindset so tragic! <br>
Technology often looks just like some magic<br>
To people who don't understand what we do. <br>
Now a switch, emulation, now middleware glue! <br>
Look at the protocols, check one or two,<br>
Debug a bit, test a bit, presto! We're through!"

My data was back! Every system checked out! <br>
Tears of joy wet my face as I wandered about. <br>
"How can I thank you? You must be Saint Nick!"<br>
He said, 'Really, my friend, it's not such a great trick,<br>
If you don't give up hope, focus on what you're doing,<br>
And read all your issues of NETWORK COMPUTING.'<br>
And I heard him exclaim, as his reindeer were coursing,<br>
"Merry Christmas to all! And consider outsourcing!
