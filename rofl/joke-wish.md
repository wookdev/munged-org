title: From the Be Careful What You Wish For Dept...

Two men were adrift in a life boat following a dramatic escape from a burning 
freight vessel. While rummaging through the boat's provisions, one of the men 
stumbled across an old lamp. Secretly hoping that a Genie would appear, he rubbed 
the lamp vigorously.</p>

To the amazement of the castaways, one did come forth. This particular Genie, 
however, stated that she could only deliver one wish, not the standard three.</p>

Without giving much thought to the matter the man blurted out, "Make 
the entire ocean into beer!"</p>

Immediately the Genie clapped her hands with a deafening crash, and the entire 
sea turned into the finest brew ever sampled by mortals.</p>

Simultaneously, the Genie vanished to her freedom. Only the gentle lapping 
of beer on the hull broke the stillness as the two men considered their circumstances. 
The other man looked disgustedly at the one whose wish had been granted.

After a long, tension-filled moment, he spoke: "Nice going Al! Now we're 
going to have to pee in the boat."!
