<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> Consumer Reports Looks at Girlfriends<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p class="words"> It has been almost 20 years since Consumer Reports reviewed 
  girlfriends (CR, Aug 1972). Since then, styles have changed, new features have 
  been introduced, and the market has changed substantially. Clearly, another 
  report was long overdue.</p>
<h3>Identifying Your Needs</h3>
<p class="words"> As with any major purchase, before obtaining a girlfriend you 
  should ask yourself exactly why you need one. Do you want an intellectual companion? 
  A baby factory? A hiking partner? Or just lots of good, old-fashioned sex? Identifying 
  your needs is the first, and most important, step in selecting a girlfriend. 
</p>
<p class="words">The potential girlfriends you see in most showrooms tend to be 
  loaded with the usual flashy accessories -- large breasts, long legs, blonde 
  hair, etc. However, there is also a wide variety of accessories designed to 
  appeal to fringe markets. For example, some models come pre-equipped with pets 
  and/or children; others can run 10 miles while chanting Sanskrit. You should 
  make a list of accessories desired, tolerated, and disliked. Note that some 
  accessories (such as children) can be added later, while others (such as a large 
  bosom) must be factory-installed.</p>
<h3>Determine Your Budget</h3>
<p class="words"> The second question, of course, is what sort of girlfriend you 
  can afford. The answer is largely determined by your physical and personal characteristics. 
  If you are good-looking and have a commanding personality and a good sense of 
  humor, you will have the resources to obtain a fancy, high-end model. On the 
  other hand, if you are ugly, smell bad, and wear polyester clothes, your choices 
  are more limited. Keep your purchasing power in mind when considering your selection.</p>
<p class="words"> Although the salesman will tell you that a girlfriend can be 
  financed, CR does not recommend this practice: due to inflating expectations, 
  the required monetary outlay will actually *increase* with time.</p>
<h3>Used vs. New?</h3>
<p class="words"> A question many girlfriend seekers have to address is whether 
  to get a new or used girlfriend. The answer to this question will, roughly speaking, 
  be determined by your age:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <h3>Your age</h3>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <h3>Used or New</h3>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words">13-18 years</td>
    <td class="words">New</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words">19-30 years</td>
    <td class="words">Lightly used</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words">31-45 years</td>
    <td class="words">Extensively used</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words">45+</td>
    <td class="words">New***</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="words"> ***Only if income exceeds $250,000/year. Otherwise, &quot;Divorced, 
  with kids.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> New girlfriends offer the advantage of having no previous bad 
  experiences to project upon you. The disadvantage is that they will rarely be 
  old enough to open a checking account. Used girlfriends, on the other hand, 
  tend to be steady, reliable performers, with the initial problems worked out. 
  CR does advise that you use caution when choosing models that have significantly 
  higher than average mileage (2.1 SO's/yr). This may be an indication that the 
  girlfriend was a professional.</p>
<h3>CR's Methodology</h3>
<p class="words"> For our purposes, girlfriends were evaluated by a dedicated 
  group of 10 test engineers, selected to typify the average male population. 
  All tests were performed at CR's specially constructed facility, which included 
  a bedroom, kitchen, and living room, and at a number of bars and taverns surrounding 
  the facility. A series of seven tests were run, evaluating each product according 
  to the following criteria: intelligence, wit, humor, empathy, initiative, looks, 
  and performance.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p class="words">Girlfriends are categorized by similarity. Within each category, 
  variation is not statistically significant.</p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top">Goddess</td>
    <td class="words" valign="top" align="left">This is the woman of your dreams. 
      She comes equipped with all of the options you want and none of the ones 
      you don't. She can argue subtle points of philosophy, give you a stiff game 
      of racquetball, understand what you mean even if you don't say it, and break 
      a bed with her enthusiasm. No mental or physical hang-ups. The drawback 
      is that this model is not actually available.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top">Goddess-In-Law</td>
    <td class="words" valign="top" align="left">This model is similar to the Goddess, 
      but comes with contractual retainers, such as a psychotic ex-husband, a 
      spiteful mother, an alcoholic father, and a bratty kid. This model tends 
      to generate grey hairs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top">Ms. Right </td>
    <td class="words" valign="top" align="left">The best all-around choice for 
      most girlfriend situations. Has most of the characteristics of the Goddess 
      except possibly in the wrong size or hair color. Other than that, an excellent 
      long- term investment. Availability is extremely limited but can occasionally 
      be found with luck.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top">Babe</td>
    <td class="words" valign="top" align="left">This is the flashy, fully-loaded 
      variety with all the options. Unfortunately this model lacks cognitive powers 
      and empathy. Showy, suitable for a parade or for impressing your friends, 
      but not for your long-term girlfriend needs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top">Friend</td>
    <td class="words" valign="top" align="left">The model with the most empathy. 
      Caring and kind but tends to be aesthetically lacking. Availability is poor 
      to fair depending on quality.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="words" align="left" valign="top"> 
      <p>Yeah, Her </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" align="left"> 
      <p class="words">The Chevy Nova of girlfriends. Widely available, but useful 
        only in a pinch, if no others are available. Tends to be spiteful or unreliable, 
        with a dull finish.</p>
    </td>
