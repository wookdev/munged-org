<p class="words">Every night, Joe would go down to the liquor store, get a six 
  pack, bring it home, and drink it while he watched TV. One night, as he finished 
  his last beer, the doorbell rank. He stumbled to the door and found a six-foot 
  cockroach standing there. The bug grabbed him by the collar and threw him across 
  the room, then left.</p>
<p class="words"> The next night, after he finished his 4th beer, the doorbell 
  rang. He walked slowly to the door and found the same six-foot cockroach standing 
  there. The big bug punched him in the stomach, then left.</p>
<p class="words"> The next night, after he finished his 1st beer, the doorbell 
  rang again. The same six-foot cockroach was standing there. This time, he was 
  kneed in the groin and hit behind the ear as he doubled over in pain. Then the 
  big bug left.</p>
<p class="words"> The fourth night Joe didn't drink at all. The doorbell rang. 
  The cockroach was standing there. The bug beat the snot out of Joe and left 
  him in a heap on the living room floor.</p>
<p class="words"> The following day, Joe went to see his doctor. He explained 
  the events of the preceding four nights. &quot;What can I do?&quot; he pleaded.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Not much&quot; the doctor replied. &quot;There's just 
  a nasty bug going around.&quot;</p>
