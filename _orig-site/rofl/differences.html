<p class="words">A Software Engineer, a Hardware Engineer and a Departmental Manager 
  were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down a steep 
  mountain road when suddenly the brakes on their car failed. The car careened 
  almost out of control down the road, bouncing off the crash barriers, until 
  it miraculously ground to a halt scraping along the mountainside. The car's 
  occupants, shaken but unhurt, now had a problem: they were stuck halfway down 
  a mountain in a car with no brakes. What were they to do?</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I know&quot;, said the Departmental Manager, &quot;Let's 
  have a meeting, propose a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, define some 
  Goals, and by a process of Continuous Improvement find a solution to the Critical 
  Problems, and we can be on our way.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;No, no&quot;, said the Hardware Engineer, &quot;That will 
  take far too long, and besides, that method has never worked before. I've got 
  my Swiss Army knife with me, and in no time at all I can strip down the car's 
  braking system, isolate the fault, fix it, and we can be on our way.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Well&quot;, said the Software Engineer, &quot;Before we 
  do anything, I think we should push the car back up the road and see if it happens 
  again.&quot;</p>
