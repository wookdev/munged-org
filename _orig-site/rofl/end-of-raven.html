<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p> by Edgar Allen Poe's cat</p>
<p> On a night quite unenchanting, when the rain was downward slanting,<br>
  I awakened to the ranting of the man I catch mice for.<br>
  Tipsy and a bit unshaven, in a tone I found quite craven,<br>
  Poe was talking to a raven perched above the chamber door.<br>
  &quot;Raven's rather tasty,&quot; mused I, tiptoeing o'er the floor,<br>
  &quot;There is nothing I like more.&quot;</p>
<p> Soft upon the rug I treaded, calm and careful as I headed<br>
  Toward his roost atop that dreaded bust of Pallas I deplore.<br>
  While the bard and birdie chattered, I made certain nothing clattered,<br>
  Creaked, or snapped, or fell, or shattered, as I crossed the corridor;<br>
  For his house is crammed with trinkets, curios and weird decor--<br>
  Bric-a-brac and junk galore.</p>
<p> Still the Raven never fluttered, standing stock-still as he uttered,<br>
  In a voice that shrieked and sputtered, his two-cents' worth: &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br>
  While this dirge the birdbrain kept up, oh, so silently I crept up,<br>
  Then I crouched and quickly leapt up, pouncing on the feathered bore.<br>
  Soon he was a heap of plumage, and a little blood and gore--<br>
  Only this and not much more.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; my pickled poet cried out, &quot;Pussycat, it's time I dried 
  out!<br>
  Never sat I in my hideout talking to a bird before.<br>
  How I've wallowed in self-pity, while my gallant, valiant kitty<br>
  Put an end to that damned ditty!&quot; Then I heard him start to snore.<br>
  Back atop the door I clambered, eyeing that statue I abhor,<br>
  Jumped--and smashed it on the floor.</p>
