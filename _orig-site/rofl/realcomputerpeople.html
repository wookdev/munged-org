<h3>Real Computer Scientists...</h3>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists admire ADA for its overwhelming aesthetic 
  value but they find it difficult to actually program in it, as it is much too 
  large to implement. Most computer scientists don't notice this because they 
  are still arguing over what else to add to ADA.</P>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists despise the idea of actual hardware. 
  Hardware has limitations, software doesn't. It's a real shame that Turing machines 
  are so poor at I/O.</P>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists don't comment their code. The identifiers 
  are so long they can't afford the disk space.</P>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists don't program in assembler. They don't 
  write in anything less portable than a number two pencil.</P>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists don't write code. They occasionally 
  tinker with &quot;programming systems&quot;, but those are so high level that 
  they hardly count (and rarely count accurately; precision is for applications).</P>
<P class="words">Real computer scientists only write specs for languages that 
  might run on future hardware. Nobody trusts them to write specs for anything 
  homo sapiens will ever be able to fit on a single planet.</P>

<h3>Real Programmers... </h3>
<P class="words">Real Programmers don't play tennis, or any other sport that requires 
  you to change clothes. Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers wear their 
  climbing boots to work in case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the middle 
  of the machine room.</P>
<P class="words">Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers donít do structured programming. Structured 
  programming is for compulsive neurotics who were prematurely toilet- trained, 
  wear neckties, and carefully line pencils up on otherwise clear desks. Real 
  programmers think structured programming is a communist plot.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches. If the vending 
  machine sells it, they eat it. If the vending machine doesn't sell it, they 
  don't eat it. Vending machines don't sell quiche.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't comment their code. It was hard to write, 
  it should be hard to understand.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't draw flowcharts. Flowcharts are, after 
  all, the illiterate's form of documentation. Cavemen drew flowcharts; look how 
  much good it did them.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't write in BASIC. Actually, no programmers 
  write in BASIC after reaching the age of 12.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't write in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for wimpy 
  engineers who wear white socks, pipe stress freaks, crystallography weenies, 
  and people who get excited about finite state analysis and nuclear reactor simulation.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't use COBOL. COBOL is for wimpy application 
  programmers.</P>
<P class="words">Real Programmers don't write in PL/I. PL/I is for programmers 
  who can't decide whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't use APL, unless the whole program can 
  be written on one line.</P>
<p class="words">Real programmers don't use LISP. Only effeminate programmers 
  use more parentheses than actual code.</p>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't write in Pascal, Bliss, Ada, or any of 
  those other commie pinko computer science languages. Strong typing is for people 
  with weak memories.</P>
<P class="words">Real Programmers don't use shared text. Otherwise, how can they 
  use functions for scratch space after they are finished calling them?</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't follow specs. Users should consider themselves 
  lucky to get any programs at all and take what they get.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't document. Documentation is for simps who 
  can't read the listings or the object deck.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't write application programs, they program 
  right down on the bare metal. Application programming is for feebs who can't 
  do systems programming.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't eat quiche. They eat Twinkies, Coke, palate-scorching 
  Szechwan food, and anything that comes out of the vending machine. Real programmers 
  don't even know how to spell quiche.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't read manuals. Reliance on a reference 
  is a hallmark of the novice and the coward.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers programs never work right the first time. But 
  if you throw them on the machine they can be patched into working in &quot;only 
  a few&quot; 30-hour debugging sessions.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers never work 9 to 5. If any real programmers are 
  around at 9 AM, it's because they were up all night.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers don't use schedules. Schedules are for managers. 
  Real programmers like to keep their manager in suspense.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers donít like managers. Managers are a necessary 
  evil, useful for dealing with personnel bozos, bean counters, senior planners, 
  and other mental defectives.</P>
<P class="words">Real programmers know what users need better than users do.</P>

<h3>Real Software Engineers... </h3>
<P class="words">Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness. 
  This process doesn't necessarily involve execution of anything on a computer, 
  except perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.</P>
<P class="words">Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable 
  and greasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any moment. 
  They have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that systems could be 
  virtual at all levels. They would like personal computers (you know no one's 
  going to trip over something and kill your DFA in mid-transit), except that 
  they need 8 megabytes to run their Correctness Verification Aid packages.</P>
<P class="words">Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the 
  way the job is described in the formal spec. Working late would feel like using 
  an undocumented external procedure.</P>

<h3>Real Users...</h3>
<P class="words">Real Users are afraid they'll break the machine -- but they're 
  never afraid to break your face.</P>
<P class="words">Real Users find the one combination of bizarre input values that 
  shuts down the system for days.</P>
<P class="words">Real Users hate Real Programmers.</P>
<P class="words">Real Users know your home telephone number.</P>
<P class="words">Real Users never know what they want, but they always know when 
  your program doesn't deliver it.</P>
<P class="words">Real Users never use Help.</P>
