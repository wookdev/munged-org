<p>The following is an actual letter of complaint which I grabbed off the net 
  many years ago (when it used to be called net.jokes, if you can remember that 
  long ago!) Unfortunately, I don't have the original source anymore.</p>
<p>Note the date sent and the prices quoted. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Atlanta, Georgia<br>
  September 13, 1970</p>
<p>Director<br>
  Billing Department<br>
  Shell Oil Company<br>
  P.O. Box XXXX<br>
  Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have been a regular customer of the Shell Oil Company for several years now, 
  and spend approximately $40.00 per month on Shell products. Until recently, 
  I have been completely satisfied with the quality of Shell products and with 
  the service of Shell employees. </p>
<p>Included in my most recent statement from your department was a bill for $12.00 
  for a tire which I purchased at the Lowell I. Reels Shell station in McAdenville, 
  N.C. I stopped at this station for gasoline and to have a timing malfunction 
  corrected. The gasoline cost $5.15; eight new plugs cost $9.36; labor on the 
  points $2.50. All well and good. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day I had a flat tire, which the attendant at the Lowell I. 
  Reels station informed me that he was unable to fix. He suggested that I purchase 
  a tire from him in order that I have a spare for the remainder of my journey 
  to Atlanta. I told him that I preferred to buy tires from home station in Atlanta, 
  but he continued to stress the risk of driving without a spare. My reluctance 
  to trade with an unknown dealer, even a Shell dealer, did not discourage him 
  and finally, as I was leaving, he said that out of concern for my safety (my 
  spare was not new) and because I had made a substantial expenditure at his station, 
  he would make me a special deal. He produced a tire (&quot;Hits a good one. 
  Still has the tits on it. See them tits. Hits a twenty dollar tar.&quot;) which 
  I purchased for twelve dollars and which he installed on the front left side 
  for sixty-five cents. Fifty miles further down the highway, I had a blowout. 
</p>
<p>Not a puncture which brought a slow, flapping flat, nor a polite ladyfinger 
  firecracker rubberburpple rupture (pop); but a howitzer blowout, which reared 
  the the hood of my car up into my face, a blowout, sir, which tore a flap of 
  rubber from this &quot;tire&quot; large enough to make soles for both sandals 
  of a medium sized hippie. In a twinkling, then, I was driving down Interstate 
  85 at sixty miles per hour on three tires and one rim with rubber clinging to 
  it in desperate shreds and patches, an instrument with a bent, revolving, steel-then-rubber-then-steel 
  rim, whose sound can be approximated by the simultaneous placing of a handful 
  of gravel and a young duck into a Waring Blender. </p>
<p>The word &quot;careen&quot; does no justice whatever to the movement that the 
  car then performed. According to the highway patrolman's report, the driver 
  in the adjoining lane, the left hand-- who, incidentally, was attempting to 
  pass me at the time-- ejaculated adrenelin all over the ceiling of his car. 
  My own passengers were fused into a featureless quiver in the key of &quot;G&quot; 
  in the back seat of my car. The rim was bent; the tits were gone; and you can 
  f--k yourself with a cream cheese dildo if you entertain for one moment the 
  delusion that I intend to pay the twelve dollars. </p>
<p>Sincerely yours, </p>
<p>/s/ T.B.T. </p>
