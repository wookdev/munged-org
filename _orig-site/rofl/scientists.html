  <dt>Chem Prof:
<blockquote>
      <p class="words">Wears a white lab coat. This may actually be clean
        but does not have to be. P-chem profs have a brand new coat that
        has never been in the lab; polymer chem profs have strange glop
        on their coat, and intro chem profs have acid holes.</p>
    </blockquote>

<p class="words">Physics Prof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Wears blue jeans and a flannel shirt. May sometimes
    forget to wear shirt altogether. If a professor is wearing blue
    jeans and suspenders, ten to one he is a physicist. Physics profs
    often have German accents, but this is not a distingushing
    characteristic. Be wary of psychologists with fake Viennese accents
    which can sound similar to the unwary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Bio Prof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Sometimes wears a lab coat, though usually this is the
    sign of a biochemist. Marine biologists walk around in hip boots
    for no explainable reason, even in the middle of winter. They
    are apt to wear grey slacks and smell like fish, as opposed to
    most biologists, who smell strongly of formalin. Microbiology
    instructors go around in spotless white coats, refuse to drink
    beer on tap, and wipe all their silverware before using it.
    Never loan money to a bio prof, no matter how much he asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Psych Prof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Psychologists are not real scientists, and can be
    easily identified by their screams of protest whenever anyone
    questions whether psychology is a science. Psych people have
    beady little eyes and don't laugh at jokes about psychology.
    If you are not sure whether a person is a scientist or a
    comparative religion instructor, he is probably a psychologist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">CS Prof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Most CS profs are from India or Pakistan. You can tell
    by the gestures and accents. This is not a bad thing, though many
    of the American CS professors tend to pick up Indian accents which
    confounds more specific identification. Like mushrooms, CS students
    only come out at night, and, if not Indian, tend to take on a
    pasty appearance. CS professors do not use computers and therefore
    can be easily identified by their comparative good health with
    respect to their students. Many CS professors do not even know how
    to use computers, and are actually mathematicians or psychologists
    in disguise. Avoid these people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words">Math Prof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words"> Math profs are like physics professors except without
    any practical bent. A math professor will have only books and
    pencils in his office, as opposed to the piles of broken equipment
    that physicists keep. Mathematicians scorn the use of computers
    and calculators and often have difficulty splitting bills in
    restaurants. The easy way to identify a mathematician is by the
    common use of the phrases &quot;It can be shown that...&quot; and &quot;Is 
    left
    as an exercise to the student...&quot;</p>
