<p class="words">'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<br>
  How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br>
  His workers no longer would answer to &quot;Elves.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Vertically Challenged&quot; they were calling themselves.<br>
  And labor conditions at the North Pole<br>
  Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.</p>
<p class="words"> Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br>
  Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br>
  And equal employment had made it quite clear<br>
  That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br>
  So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br>
  Were replaced with four pigs, and you know that looked stupid!</p>
<p class="words"> The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<br>
  The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br>
  And people had started to call for the cops<br>
  When they heard roof noises up on their roof-tops.<br>
  Smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br>
  His fur-trimmed red suit was called &quot;Unenlightened.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br>
  Rudolf would sue o'er the use of his nose<br>
  And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br>
  Asking millions of dollars in due compensation.</p>
<p class="words"> So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<br>
  Who suddenly said she'd had enough of this life,<br>
  Joined a self-helping group, and left in a whiz,<br>
  Demanding from now on her title was Ms.</p>
<p class="words"> And as for the gifts, he'd ne'er had a notion<br>
  That making a choice could cause such commotion.<br>
  Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br>
  Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br>
  Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br>
  Nothing to aim and nothing to shoot.<br>
  Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br>
  Nothing for just girls, or just for the boys.<br>
  Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br>
  Nothing that's warlike and so, non-pacific.<br>
  or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br>
  Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br>
  And fairy tales too, while not yet forbidden,<br>
  Were like Ken and Barbie...(just better off hidden.)<br>
  For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br>
  Who said the only good gift was one ecological.</p>
<p class="words"> No baseball, not football...someone could get hurt;<br>
  Besides, playing sports exposed kids to the dirt.<br>
  Dolls were too sexist, and should be passe;<br>
  And Nintendo, 'twas found, rots your brain cells away.</p>
<p class="words"> So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<br>
  He just couldn't figure out what to do next.<br>
  He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br>
  (But you've got to be careful with that word today.)<br>
  His sack was quite empty, lay limp on the ground;<br>
  No suitable gift for this year could be found.</p>
<p class="words"> Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br>
  Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br>
  A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br>
  Each group of people and every religion;<br>
  Every ethnicity, each color and hue,<br>
  Everyone, everywhere...even to you.</p>
<p class="words"> So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br>
  May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.&quot;</p>
