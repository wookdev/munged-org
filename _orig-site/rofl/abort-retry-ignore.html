<p class="words">Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,<br>
  System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,<br>
  Longing for the warmth of bedsheets, <br>
  Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets:<br>
  Having reached the bottom line,<br>
  I took a floppy from the drawer.<br>
  Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command<br>
  But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore". </p>
<p class="words"> Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion?<br>
  These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before.<br>
  Carefully, I weighed my options.<br>
  These three seemed to be the top ones.<br>
  Clearly, I must now adopt one -<br>
  Choose : "Abort, Retry, Ignore". </p>
<p class="words"> With my fingers pale and trembling,<br>
  Slowly toward the keyboard bending,<br>
  Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,<br>
  Praying for some guarantee<br>
  Finally I pressed a key --<br>
  But on the screen what did I see?<br>
  Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore". </p>
<p class="words"> I tried to catch the chips off-guard --<br>
  I pressed again, but twice as hard.<br>
  Luck was just not in the cards,<br>
  I saw what I had seen before.<br>
  Now I typed in desperation,<br>
  Trying random comninations.<br>
  Still there came the incantation -<br>
  Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore". </p>
<p class="words"> There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted;<br>
  Getting up, I turned away and paced across the office floor.<br>
  And then I saw an awful sight,<br>
  A bold and blinding flash of light,<br>
  A lightning bolt that cut the night and shook me to my very core.<br>
  The PC screen collapsed and died,<br>
  "Oh no -- my database", I cried.<br>
  I thought I heard a voice reply,<br>
  "You'll see your data -- Nevermore!" </p>
<p class="words"> To this day I do not know<br>
  The place to which our data goes<br>
  Perhaps it goes to Heaven where the angels have it stored.<br>
  But as for productivity - well,<br>
  I fear that it goes straight to Hell.<br>
  And that's the tale I have to tell -<br>
  Your choice: Abort, Retry, Ignore. </p>
