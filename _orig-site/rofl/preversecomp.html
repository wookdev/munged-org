<p><h1>GUIDE TO PERVERSE COMPUTING v1.0</h1><p>
 
<p><h2>by Alan Meiss, ameiss@gn.ecn.purdue.edu</h2><p></p>
 
 
<p><h3>Using the Line Printer</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>If your printout does not arrive within 1.2 seconds, immediately take the
  printer offline and press line feed enough times to place the perforation
  in the center of all subsequent printouts.  Leave the printer in this
  inoperative state, but be sure to place your document (140k minimum) in
  the queue at least five (5) more times before going home.  In the unlikely
  event you return for your output, give it a cursory glance before
  discarding in a convenient location.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Be sure and send graphics output to the line printer as often as possible.
  Fill at least 200 pages with brief cryptic strings such as q:!@ in the
  corner.  After observing that this output does not match the plot you
  intended, perform the exact same action a second time, in the hope that the
  first error was simply the result of intervention by evil spirits.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Wad, crush, crumple, stomp, spindle, paw, and rip at least six (6) other
  users' output in retrieving your own.  Broadcast this refuse in random
  directions or coat the vicinity of the printer with it in an act of
  Cristo-like performance art.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Note to administrators: change the print ribbon at least once every
  presidential administration, whether it needs it or not.  Ensure that the
  print queue is mysteriously disabled before all major class projects,
  and that name/banner/whitespace pages exceed printed output by a ratio of
  at least 3:1.</li><p></p>
</ul> 
 
<p><h3>Using Dot Matrix Printers</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>Randomly strewn tractor feed paper edges give your workspace that festive,
  ticker-tape parade atmosphere.  Fling these everywhere so your fellow users
  will feel like returning Mercury astronauts.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Make sure the paper will wrap around and re-insert itself into the tractor
  feed while you've left to pee.</li><p></p>
</ul> 
 
<p><h3>Using the Laser Printer</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>At the slightest delay, begin randomly pushing buttons on the front panel.
  If this elicits no favorable response, switch the printer on and off several
  times.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Do not bother busy service personnel with problems, perform maintenance
  yourself.  Insert paper haphazardly in the tray to ensure that it will
  misfeed or jam so thoroughly in the rollers that disassembly is required.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Remember that the twenty people behind you in the queue are just as eager
  as you to see your 1200k postscript printout of HOTMAMA9.GIF.  Be sure and
  make copies for all of them, too.  Make sure that at least one copy is not
  in encapsulated form, so that rather than HOTMAMA9 the other users clustered
  around the printer are treated to the even more invigorating spectacle of
  the single remaining ream of paper being filled with vital information such
  as M#6%%iou{{^pK/$.</li><p></p>
</ul> 
 
<p><h3>Using Terminals</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>Those mysterious functions keys at the top must be good for something, so
  press them all.  Whine loudly when the terminal subsequently displays the
  Magna Carta in inverse video and locks up.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Seek out all possible actions that produce a bell/beep, and perform them at
  least 9,734 times over the next half hour.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Achieve a sense of oneness with the information on the screen by pressing
  your grubby greasy mitts all over it.  Make sure there are at least three
  clear prints for each finger.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Leave mysterious and/or repulsive stains or goo on the most frequently used
  keys.  Make sure to extend your own casual approach to hygiene to your
  favorite terminal.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Note to administrators: be vigilant in guarding against novice users learning
  vital secrets such as how to set their terminal type.  Remember, ex and edlin
  build character.  Furtheeeer, makeeee sureeee that at leeeeast oneeee keeey
  sticks on all teeeerminals.</li><p></p>
</ul> 
 
<p><h3>Workstations:</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>If the workstation has locked up, or is not performing with the proper pep
  and vigor you expect, switch it on and off a few times just like your pc.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Run large jobs on at least five (5) workstations at once from remote logins
  for the true sensation of multitasking.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Note to administrators: at all costs, DO NOT let mere users obtain sensitive
  information such as how to run various windowing systems or properly set
  their path.  Actual productive use of workstations creates wear and
  eventually necessitates replacement.  Hide all manuals at an undisclosed
  location on the Ross Ice Shelf.  Make sure users are able to set their
  cursor to Gumby shape, but do not renew vital software licenses on a timely
  basis.</li><p></p>
</ul> 
 
<p><h3>Programming:</h3><p></p>
 
<ul>
<p><li>To guard against any future deciphering of your code, use less-than-
  illuminating variable names such as a, b, and c.  However, for the most
  frequently used variables, assign names such as "this_is_my_new_value".</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>In Fortran, make sure to use undeclared variables starting with the letter
  m for real values.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>If your code isn't working, be sure to fish through the trash to find some
  that does.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Remember, no task is too simple or brief to perform on a mainframe.  Anything
  done on a pc, even generating times tables, is inherently suspect.  A brief
  C or Pascal program written on your pc in a convenient ten minutes simply
  can't compare to the grandeur of a 400k executable file running on a decrepit
  behemoth the size of a recreational vehicle.  Even if your results are wrong,
  just think of the precision to which they will be wrong.</li><p></p>
 
<p><li>Core dumps are fun!  Copy them here, there, and everywhere, mail them to
  friends, and list them to lock your terminal or make it squeal.  Take full
  advantage of this valuable service needed by at least a whopping 0.001% of
  the computing public.</li><p></p>
</ul>
