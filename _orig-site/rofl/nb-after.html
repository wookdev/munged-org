<p class="words"> By Lorraine Metivier </p>
<p class="words"> Twas the nite after christmas and all through the house<br>
  Was a wall to wall mess, no room for a mouse.</p>
<p class="words"> The new toys are scattered, in every wich way.<br>
  Trains, dolls and games, just everything to play.</p>
<p class="words"> The stockings that were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
  are now on the floor, and full of dog hair.</p>
<p class="words"> The dear little children, from short ones to tall,<br>
  This day are fed pepto-Bismal</p>
<p class="words"> For their tummies are stuffed with all kinds of things.<br>
  Like candy and peanuts and pineapple rings.</p>
<p class="words"> The children are cranking from not enough sleep.<br>
  They fight over toys, two boys and one jeep.</p>
<p class="words"> Timmy can't find the wheels to his small model car<br>
  How on earth did they get in the baby food jar?</p>
<p class="words"> Sis is still crying, here eyes are all red.<br>
  Our puppy has chewed off her Barbi Dolls head.</p>
<p class="words"> Poor mom is trying to vacume and broom.<br>
  To organize the house, or at least just one room.</p>
<p class="words"> And dad with his tools, grunts and just trembles<br>
  he gets madder and madder with each toy he assembles.</p>
<p class="words"> Just when Mom and Dad try to sit down to relax.<br>
  Here comes more company, Aunt Flo and Uncle Max.</p>
<p class="words"> Dad has a drink with them, just to be polite<br>
  Like he did with the others, how many tonight?</p>
<p class="words"> Poor Dad's got a headache, his eyes are all red.<br>
  He sure does look funny, with the lampshade on his head.</p>
<p class="words"> They all settle down, from puppy to dad.<br>
  The children thank the lord for the Christmas they had.</p>
<p class="words"> Twas the nite after Christmas in their beds they all lay.<br>
  They must get their rest, to face New Years Day!</p>
