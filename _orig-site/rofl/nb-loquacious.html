<p class="words">  'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding 
  the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic
   activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,
   including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus. Hosiery 
  was
   meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric
   apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent
   visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric
   appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.
</p>
<p class="words">  The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their 
  respective
   accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual
   hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through
   their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head
   coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness
   when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended 
  such
   a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity 
  from
   my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.
</p>
<p class="words">  Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers 
  sealing this
   fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected
   as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be
   said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my
   incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered
   conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,
   piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it
   became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller.
   With his ungulate motive power travelling at what may possibly have been
   more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated
   loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed
   each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen - &quot;Now Dasher, 
  now
   Dancer...&quot; et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of 
  our
   abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the
   concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.
</p>
<p class="words">  As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, 
  and was performing a
   180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity
   and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad
   entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of
   carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His
   resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of
   assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.
</p>
<p class="words">  His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while 
  his submaxillary
   dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The
   capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with
   blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating 
  the
   coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus avium,
   or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so
   much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment
   appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.
</p>
<p class="words">  Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece 
  whose grey fumes,
   forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative
   seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and when
   he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in 
  the
   manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, 
  in
   short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, 
  the
   optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every
   effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating 
  one
   eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that
   trepidation on my part was groundless.
</p>
<p class="words">  Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling 
  the aforementioned
   appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise
   extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth
   receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face,
   placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory
   organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and
   forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke
   passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance,
   directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter 
  to
   the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement
   hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common
   weed. But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior 
  to
   his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: &quot;Ecstatic Yuletide 
  to the
   planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest
   wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period
   between sunset and dawn.&quot;</p>
