<p class="words">You know that book &quot;Men are from Mars, Women from Venus&quot;? 
  Well, here's a prime example of that.</p>
<p class="words">This assignment was actually turned in by two of my English students:</p>

<p class="words"> In-class Assignment for Wednesday Today we will experiment with 
  a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple. Each person will 
  pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right. One of you will 
  then write the first paragraph of a short story. The partner will read the first 
  paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story. The first person will 
  then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth. Remember to re-read what 
  has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is 
  over when both agree a conclusion has been reached.</p>

<p class="words">At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. 
  The camomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded 
  her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked camomile. 
  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness 
  was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting 
  up again. So camomile was out of the question.</p>
<p class="words"> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="words"> Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack 
  squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about 
  than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he 
  had spent one sweaty night over a year ago. &quot;A.S. Harris to Geostation 
  17,&quot; he said into his transgalactic communicator. &quot;Polar orbit established. 
  No sign of resistance so far...&quot; But before he could sign off a bluish 
  particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo 
  bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across 
  the cockpit.</p>
<p class="words"> -----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="words"> He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before 
  he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who 
  had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless 
  hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4.&quot;Congress Passes Law 
  Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel.&quot; Laurie read in her newspaper 
  one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out 
  the window, dreaming of youth -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, 
  with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of 
  innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. &quot;Why must one lose 
  one's innocence to become a woman?&quot; she pondered wistfully.</p>
<p class="words"> -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="words"> Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live. 
  Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first 
  of its lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the 
  Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless 
  target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human 
  race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships 
  were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire 
  planet. With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. 
  The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, 
  in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast 
  of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 
  85 million other Americans. The President slammed his fist on the conference 
  table. &quot;We can't allow this! I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow'em 
  out of the sky!&quot;</p>

<p class="words"> This is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. 
  My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent.</p>
<p class="words"> ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="words"> Yeah? Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts 
  at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.</p>
