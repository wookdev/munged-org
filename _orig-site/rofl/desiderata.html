<p> Go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be 
  in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. 
  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and 
  ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they 
  are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become 
  vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. 
  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, 
  however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise 
  caution in your business affairs; for the world in full of trickery. But let 
  this not blind you to what virtue there is: many persons strive for high ideals; 
  and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign 
  affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and 
  disenchantment it is perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the 
  years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit 
  to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. 
  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, 
  be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees 
  and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to 
  you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace 
  with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, 
  in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, 
  drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive 
  to be happy.</p>
