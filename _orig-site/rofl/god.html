<p><cite>I have a God, too. Only most people call it a toilet. I have a special 
    room in my house for my God and I visit it several times a day to see that 
    it is getting enough water and nutrients. That way if people ask me if I believe 
    in God, I can say:</cite></p>
  <p><cite>&quot;Of course I believe in God, there has always been a special place 
    for God in my home and I sometimes feel very close to God. Just knowing that 
    God is there is a source of great comfort to me.&quot;</cite> </p>

<p>This is one of the best pieces I've read on alt.atheism in a while (which may 
  tell you what I consider things to have been like lately ;-) This has great 
  possibilities...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> &quot;I once was a great sinner, indulging in strong drink, but one night 
    in my wickedness I found myself kneeling before God, pouring out my repentance; 
    evil spirits were expelled from me, and consumed by God. I prostrated myself 
    before God then, and slept the sleep of the innocent.&quot;</p>
  <p> &quot;Truly our society could not function without God. Not only is there 
    a special place in <strong>my</strong> home for God, but in every true American 
    home and place of business as well. I know that even when I travel I can turn 
    to God in my time of need. Although our founding fathers did not know God 
    exactly as we do today, they would never envision an America with no God at 
    all. Those who reject God are defiled by their actions and risk spreading 
    their filth to those around them.&quot;</p>
  <p> &quot;My thoughts never stray too long away from God. At times when God 
    seems farthest away, that is when then God is foremost in my thoughts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure now that I will be snickering for weeks at the most innocuous of theistic 
  postings...</p>
