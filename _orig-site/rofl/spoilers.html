  Subject: Re: Don't post Jane Eyre spoilers! </p>
<p class="words">All these spoilers are pissing me off. For instance, I was reading 
  a book called the Gospels (an inferior sequel to an old Hebrew series called 
  the Torah). I'm up to the part when their crucifying the Jesus character, and 
  some nut comes up to me and says, &quot;Jesus died and rose again. Hallelujah!&quot; 
  totally ruining the ending for me.</p>
<p class="words">I found the ending a little disappointing anyway. He comes back 
  to life? How cheap. It's almost as bad as saying the whole thing was a dream. 
  I was hoping that that God character would send a few plagues or turn Pontius 
  Pilate into a pillar of salt or something. That's exciting. That's drama. The 
  moral is: Don't read sequels. (By the way, I hear that this Mohammed guy has 
  done a new version of the Bible series called the Quran. I haven't read it yet, 
  so don't nobody tell me how it ends.)</p>
