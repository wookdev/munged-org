<p class="words">Dear Architect: </p>
<p class="words">Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what 
  I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have between two 
  and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms 
  can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I will 
  make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown for 
  each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one. Keep in mind that the 
  house I ultimately choose must cost less than the one I am currently living 
  in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the deficiencies that exist in 
  my current house (the floor of my kitchen vibrates when I walk across it, and 
  the walls don't have nearly enough insulation in them).</p>
<p class="words">As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance 
  costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost features 
  like aluminum, vinyl or composite siding. (If you choose not to specify aluminum, 
  be prepared to explain your decision in detail.) Please take care that modern 
  design practices and the latest materials are used in construction of the house, 
  as I want it to be a showplace for the most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be 
  alerted, however, that the kitchen should be designed to accommodate, among 
  other things, my 1952 Gibson refrigerator.</p>
<p class="words">To ensure that you are building the correct house for our entire 
  family, make certain that you contact each of our children, and also our in-laws. 
  My mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should be 
  designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you weigh 
  all of these options carefully and come to the right decision. I, however, retain 
  the right to overrule any choices that you make. </p>
<p class="words">Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job 
  is to develop the overall plans for the house: get the big picture. At this 
  time, for example, it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the carpet. 
  However, keep in mind that my wife likes blue. Also, do not worry at this time 
  about acquiring the resources to build the house itself. Your first priority 
  is to develop detailed plans and specifications. Once I approve these plans, 
  however, I would expect the house to be under roof within 48 hours. </p>
<p class="words">While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep 
  in mind that sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore 
  should have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Please make sure before 
  you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population in my area 
  that they like the features this house has. I advise you to run up and look 
  at my neighbor's house that he constructed last year. We like it a great deal. 
  It has many features that we would also like in our new home, particularly the 
  25 meter swimming pool. With careful engineering, I believe that you can design 
  this into our new home without impacting the final cost. </p>
<p class="words">Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary 
  at this time to do the real design, since they will be used only for construction 
  bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable for any increase 
  of construction costs as a result of later design changes. </p>
<p class="words">You must be thrilled to be working on as interesting a project 
  as this! To be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given 
  such freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often. Contact 
  me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans.</p>
<p class="words">P.S. My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of 
  the instructions that I've given you in this letter. As the architect, it is 
  your responsibility to resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and 
  have been unable to accomplish this. If you can't handle this responsibility, 
  I will have to find another architect.</p>
<p class="words">P.P.S. Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel 
  trailer. Please advise me as soon as possible if this is the case.</p>
