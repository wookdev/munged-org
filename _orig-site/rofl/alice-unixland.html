<p class="words"> Alice was reading the message on her monitor and beginning to 
  suspect
  that everything was not as it should be. &quot;Program too big to fit in
  memory,&quot; it read.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; she said, &quot;All I did 
  was load
  fourteen TSRs before starting my word processor. With four megabytes,
  I wish I could use more than 640K.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;At that moment, a small white consultant ( a very white
  consultant) ran across the room. &quot;Oh my coat and necktie,&quot; he said,
  &quot;I'm going to be late for my appointment. And at one fifty an hour,
  too.&quot; Before Alice could say anything, he leaped into her monitor and
  disappeared behind her operating system.</p>
<p class="words"> Alice thought that she had never seen anyone leap into a monitor
  before; and certainly not go clean through the operating system. But
  then, she had been told that DOS was very shallow. Without hesitating
  a moment, she leaped in after him.</p>
<p class="words"> She found herself in a shiny corridor. Not knowing what else 
  to
  do, she began walking. Turning a corner, she found herself facing two
  fat little men, each with an arm round the other's neck. One had &quot;POS&quot;
  embroidered on his collar, and the &quot;NEG&quot;.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I know,&quot; said Alice, &quot;you two are a transistor.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Positive.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Can you help me? asked Alice.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;No,&quot; said Negative.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;I'm looking for a white consultant.&quot; Alice pointed 
  in the
  direction she had been walking. &quot;Did he go this way?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;No,&quot; said Negative.</p>
<p class="words"> She pointed the other way.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Positive.</p>
<p class="words"> Soon Alice came upon a large brown table. The Consultant was
  there, as was an apparently Mad Hacker, and several creatures that
  Alice did not recognize. In one corner sat a Dormouse fast asleep.
  Over the table was a large sign that read &quot;UNIX Conference.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Everyone except the Dormouse was holding a paper cup, from which 
  they were sampling what appeared to be custard. &quot;Wrong flavor,&quot; they 
  all declared as they passed the cup to the creature on their right and graciously 
  took the one being offered on their left. Alice watched them repeat this ritual 
  three or four times before she approached and sat down.</p>
<p class="words"> Immediately, a large toad leaped into her lap and looked at 
  her
  as if it wanted to be loved. &quot;Grep,&quot; it exclaimed.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Don't mind him,&quot; explained the Mad Hacker. &quot;He's 
  just looking
  for some string.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Nroff?&quot; asked the Frog.</p>
<p class="words"> The Mad Hacker handed Alice a cup of custard-like substance 
  and
  a spoon. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;what do you think of this?&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;It looks lovely,&quot; said Alice, &quot;very sweet.&quot; 
  She tried a
  spoonful. &quot;Yuck!&quot; she cried. &quot;It's awful. What is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Oh just another graphic interface for UNIX,&quot; answered 
  the
  Hacker.</p>
<p class="words"> Alice pointed to the sleeping Dormouse. &quot;Who's he?&quot; 
  she asked.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;That's OS Too,&quot; explained the Hacker. &quot;We've 
  pretty much given
  up on waking him.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Just than, a large, Blue Elephant sitting next to the 
  Dormouse
  stood up. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he trumpeted pompously, &quot;as 
  the
  largest creature here, I feel impelled to state that we must take an
  Open Look at...&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> A young Job Sparrow on the other side of the table stood up
  angrily. The Elephant noticed and changed his speech
  accordingly.&quot;...what our NextStep will be.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Half the creatures bowed in respect while the other half
  snickered quietly to themselves. Just then, OS Too fell over in his
  sleep, crashing into the Elephant and taking him down with him. No one
  seemed a bit surprised.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;What we need,&quot; declared a Sun Bear as he lapped up 
  custard with
  his long tongue,&quot; is a flavor that goes down like the Macintosh.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Suddenly, the White Consultant began jumping up and down 
  as his
  face got red. &quot;No, no, no! he screamed. &quot;No one pays one fifty an
  hour to Macintosh consultants!&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Awk,&quot; said the Frog.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Users,&quot; explained the Sun Bear, &quot;want an easy 
  interface that
  they will not have to learn.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Users?&quot; cried the Consultant in disbelief. &quot;Users?! 
  You mean
  secretaries, accountants, architects. Manual laborers!&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Well,&quot; responded the Sun Bear, &quot;we've got to 
  do something to
  make them want to switch to UNIX.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Do you think,&quot; said a Woodpecker who had been busy 
  making a
  hole in the table, &quot;that there might be a problem with the name `UNIX?'
  I mean, it does sort of suggest being less than a man.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Maybe we should try another name, &quot; suggested the 
  Job Sparrow,
  &quot;like Brut, or Rambo.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Penix,&quot; suggested a Penguin.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Mount,&quot; said the Frog, &quot;spawn.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Alice slapped him. &quot;Nice?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;But then again,&quot; suggested the Woodpecker, &quot;what 
  about the
  shrinkwrap issue?&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Suddenly, everyone leaped up and started dashing about, waving
  their hands in the air and screaming. Just as suddenly, they all sat
  down again.</p>
<p class="words">
  &quot;Now that that's settled,&quot; said the Woodpecker, &quot;let's go back
  to tasting flavors.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Everyone at the table sampled a new cup of custard. &quot;Wrong
  flavor,&quot; they all declared as they passed the cup to the creature on
  their right and took the one being offered on their left.</p>
<p class="words"> Totally confused, Alice got up and left. After she had been
  walking away, she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Rem,&quot; is said, &quot;edlin.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> Alice turned and saw the Frog. She smiled. &quot;Those are queer
  sounding words,&quot; she said, &quot;but at least I know what they mean.&quot;</p>
<p class="words"> &quot;Chkdsk,&quot; said the Frog.</p>
