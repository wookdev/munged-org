<p>  Some people say cats never have to be bathed. They say cats lick
   themselves clean. They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in
   their saliva that works like new, improved Wisk - dislodging the dirt
   where it hides and whisking it away.</p>
<p>  I've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind
   believers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary -
   the kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt
   smudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace.</p>
<p>  The time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must
   look squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary
   and announce: &quot;This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in
   Juarez.&quot;</p>
<p>  When that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some
   advice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you
   arm and head for the bathtub:</p>
<p> Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern 
  for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage 
  by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he 
  can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is 
  more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat 
  and close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A 
  simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber 
  shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)</p>
<p> Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from 
  your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to 
  protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction 
  boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face mask and a 
  long-sleeve flak jacket.</p>
<p> Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel when 
  you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water. Make sure 
  the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make sure the towel 
  can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the water.</p>
<p> Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply 
  carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. 
  They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If he does notice your 
  garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a product- testing experiment 
  for J.C. Penney.)</p>
<p> Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single 
  liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the 
  glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have 
  begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. </p>
<p>Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem 
  is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more that two or 
  three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give 
  him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and 
  fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record 
  is - for cats - three latherings, so don't expect too much.)</p>
<p> Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will 
  be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the 
  cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared 
  to what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semi-permanently 
  affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach 
  for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging 
  to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is 
  to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water 
  is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the 
  cat.</p>
<p>  In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg.
   He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will
   spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become
   psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.</p>
<p>  You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the
   case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your
   defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him
   a bath. But, at least now he smells a lot better.</p>
