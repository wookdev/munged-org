<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> The Night Before Chanukah<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" -->   'Twas the night before Chanukah, boychicks 
and maidels<br>
  Not a sound could be heard, not even the draidels.<br>
  The Menorah was set on the chimney, alight<br>
  In the kitchen the Bubba hut gechapt a bite.<br>
  Salami, pastrami, a glessala tay<br>
  And zayerah pickles with bagels, oy vay!<br>
  Gezunt and geschmack, the kinderlech felt<br>
  While dreaming of tagelach and Chanukah gelt.
<p>   The clock on the mantlepiece away was tickin'<br>
    And Bubba was serving a schtickala chicken.<br>
    A tumult arose like a thousand brauches,<br>
    Santa had fallen and broken his tuches.<br>
    I put on my slippers, eins, tsvay, drei,<br>
    While Bubba was now on the herring and rye.<br>
    I grabbed for my bathrobe and buttoned my gotkes<br>
    While Bubba was busy devouring the latkes.</p>
<p>   To the window I ran and to my surprise<br>
    A little red yarmulka greeted my eyes.<br>
    Then he got to the door and saw the Menorah,<br>
    &quot;Yiddishe kinder,&quot; he said, &quot;Kenehora.<br>
    I thought I was in a goyisha hoise,<br>
    But as long as I'm here, I'll leave a few toys.&quot;</p>
<p>   With much gesshray, I asked, &quot;Du bist a Yid?&quot;<br>
    &quot;Avada, mein numen is Schloimey Claus, kid.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Come into the kitchen, I'll get you a dish,<br>
    A guppell, a schtickala fish.&quot;<br>
    With smacks of delight, he started his fressen,<br>
    Chopped liver, knaidlach and kreplah gegessen.<br>
    Along with his meal, he had a few schnapps,<br>
    When it came to eating, this boy was the tops.</p>
<p>   He asked for some knishes with pepper and salt,<br>
    But they were so hot, he yelled &quot;Oy Gevalt.&quot;<br>
    Unbuttoning his haizen, he rose from the tisch,<br>
    And said, &quot;Your Kosher essen is simply delish.&quot;<br>
    As he went to the door, he said &quot;I'll see you later,<br>
    I'll be back next Pesach, in time for the Seder.&quot;</p>
<p>   More rapid than eagles his prancers they came,<br>
    As he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br>
    &quot;Now Izzy, now Morris, now Yitzak, now Sammy,<br>
    Now Irving and Maxie, and Moishe and Mannie.&quot;<br>
    He gave a gesshray as he drove out of sight:<br>
    &quot;Gooten Yomtov to all, and to all a good night.&quot;</p>
