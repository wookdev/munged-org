<p class="words">Long ago, in the days when all disks flopped in the breeze and 
  the writing of words was on a star, the Blue Giant dug for the people the Pea 
  Sea. But he needed a creature who could sail the waters, and would
  need for support but few rams. </p>
<p class="words">So the Gateskeeper, who was said to be both micro and soft, fashioned 
  a
  Dosfish, which was small and spry, and could swim the narrow
  sixteen-bit channel. But the Dosfish was not bright, and could be
  taught few new tricks. His alphabet had no As, Bs, or Qs, and only a
  mere 640 Ks, and the size of his file cabinet was limited by his own
  fat. </p>
<p class="words">At first the people loved the Dosfish, as he was the only one 
  who could
  swim the Pea Sea. But the people soon grew tired of commanding his
  line, and complained that he could be neither dragged nor dropped.
  &quot;Gadzooks!&quot; cried they. &quot;The Dosfish can do only one job at a 
  time, and
  of names, he knows but eight and three!&quot; And many of them left the Pea
  Sea for good, going off to search for the Magic Apple. </p>
<p class="words">Although many went, far more stayed because admittance to the 
  Pea Sea
  was cheap. So the Gateskeeper studied the Magic Apple, and rested
  awhile in the Parc of Xer-Ox, whereupon he fashioned a Window that
  could ride on the Dosfish and do the thinking for it. But the Window
  was slow, and it would break when the Dosfish got confused. So most
  people resigned themselves to the Dosfish. </p>
<p class="words">Now it came to pass that the Blue Giant visited the Gateskeeper, 
  and
  spake thus: &quot;Come, let us make of ourselves something greater than the
  Dosfish.&quot; The Blue Giant seemed like a humbug, so they called the new
  creature Oz II. </p>
<p class="words">Now Oz II was smarter than the Dosfish (as most things are). 
  It could
  drag and drop and keep files without becoming fat. But the people cared
  for it not. So the Blue Giant and the Gateskeeper promised another Oz
  II, to be called Oz II Too, that could swim the fast, new, 32-bit wide
  Pea Sea. </p>
<p class="words">But lo! A strange miracle occurred. Although the Window that 
  rode on
  the Dosfish was slow, it was pretty, and the third Window was the
  prettiest. And the people began to like this third Window, and to use
  it. So the Gateskeeper turned to the Blue Giant and said, &quot;Fie on thee,
  for I need thee not. Keep thy OZ II Too, and I shall make of my Window
  an Entity that will not need the Dosfish, and will swim in the 32-bit
  Pea Sea.&quot; </p>
<p class="words">Years passed, and the workshops of the Gateskeeper and the Blue 
  Giant
  were overrun by many insects. And the people went on using their
  Dosfish with a Window. And, even though the Dosfish would, from time to
  time, become confused and die, it could always be revived with three
  fingers. </p>
<p class="words">Then came the day when the Blue Giant unleashed his OZ II Too 
  onto the
  world. The Oz II Too was indeed mighty, and awesome, and required a
  great ram, but the world was changed not a whit. For the people said,
  &quot;It is indeed great, but we see little application for it.&quot; And they
  were doubtful, because the Blue Giant had met with the Magic Apple, and
  together they were fashioning a Taligent, and the Taligent was made of
  objects, and was most pink. </p>
<p class="words">Now the Gateskeeper had grown ambitious, and as he had been ambitious
  before he grew, he was now more ambitious still. So he protected his
  Window Entity with great security, and made its net work both in
  serving and with peers. And the Entity would swim, not only in the Pea
  Sea, but in the Oceans of Great Risk. &quot;Yea,&quot; declared the Gateskeeper,
  &quot;though my entity will require a greater ram than Oz II Too, it will be
  more powerful than a world of Eunuchs!&quot; </p>
<p class="words">And so the Gateskeeper prepared to unleash his Entity to the 
  world, in
  all but two cities. For he promised that a greater Window, a greater
  Entity, and an even greater Dosfish would appear one day in Chicago and
  Cairo, and it, too, would be built of objects. </p>
<p class="words">Now the Eunuchs who lived in the Oceans of Great Risk, and who 
  scorned
  the Pea Sea, began to look upon their world with fear. For the Pea Sea
  had grown, and great ships were sailing in it. The Entity was about to
  invade their oceans, and it was rumored that files would be named in
  letters beyond eight. And the Eunuchs looked upon the Pea Sea, and many
  of them thought to immigrate. </p>
<p class="words">Within the Oceans of Great Risk were many Sun Worshippers, and 
  they
  wanted to excel, and make their words perfect, and do their jobs as
  easy as one-two-three. And what's more, many of them no longer wanted
  to pay for the Risk. So the Sun Lord went to the Pea Sea. and got
  himself eighty-sixed. </p>
<p class="words">And, taking the next step, was He of the NextStep, who had given 
  up
  building his boxes of black. And he proclaimed loudly that he could
  help anyone make wondrous soft wares, then admitted meekly that only
  those who know him could use those wares, and he was made of objects,
  and required the biggest ram of all. </p>
<p class="words">And the people looked out upon the Pea Sea, and they were sore 
  amazed.
  And sore confused. And sore sore. And that is why, to this day, Ozzes,
  Entities, and Eunuchs battle on the shores of the Pea Sea but the
  people still travel on the simple Dosfish. </p>
