<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> 
<p class="words">From: samjones@leo.unm.edu (Sam Jones)</p>
<p class="words"> This is my own, though the style is a blatant copy of Matt Groening. 
  Scon is short for Student Consultant. Scons are people hired to help users learn 
  and work with the university's machinery. A pod is a UNM term for a place where 
  such machinery is made available.</p>
<span class="title">The nine types of users</span> 
<p><font face="Optima, Palatino, Times, serif"><strong>El Explicito</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="words">&quot;I tried the thing, ya know, and it worked, ya know, but 
    now<br>
    it doesn't, ya know?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="words"> Advantages: Provides interesting communication challanges.<br>
  Disadvantages: So do chimps.<br>
  Symptoms: Complete inability to use proper nouns<br>
  Real Case: One user walked up to a certain Armenian pod manager and said, &quot;I 
  <br>
  can't get what I want!&quot; The pod manager leaned back, put his hands on his 
  <br>
  belt-buckle, and said, &quot;Well, ma'am, you've come to the right place.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Mad Bomber - &quot;Well, I hit ALT-f6, shift-f8, CNTRL-f10, f4, 
  and f9, and now it<br>
  looks all weird.&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Will try to find own solution to problems.<br>
  Disadvantages: User might have translated document to Navajo without meaning<br>
  to.<br>
  Symptoms: More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-letter ratio in 
  <br>
  WordPerfect<br>
  Real Case: One user came in complaining that his WordPerfect document was <br>
  underlined. When I used reveal codes on it, I found that he'd set and unset 
  <br>
  underline more than fifty times in his document.</p>
<p class="words">Frying Pan/Fire Tactician - &quot;It didn't work with the data 
  set we had, so I <br>
  fed in my aunt's recipe for key lime pie.&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Will usually fix error.<br>
  Disadvantages: 'Fix' is defined VERY loosely here.<br>
  Symptoms: A tendancy to delete lines that get errors instead of fixing <br>
  them.<br>
  Real Case: One user complained that their program executed, but didn't do <br>
  anything. The scon looked at it for twenty minutes before realizing that <br>
  they'd commented out EVERY LINE. The user said, &quot;Well, that was the only 
  <br>
  way I could get it to compile.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Shaman - &quot;Last week, when the moon was full, the clouds 
  were thick, and<br>
  formahaut was above the horizon, I typed f77, and lo, it did compile.&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Gives insight into primative mythology.<br>
  Disadvantages: Few scons are anthropology majors.<br>
  Symptoms: Frequent questions about irrelavent objects.<br>
  Real Case: One user complained that all information on one of their disks got 
  <br>
  erased (as Norton Utilities showed nothing but empty sectors, I suspect <br>
  nothing <br>
  had ever been on it). Reasoning that the deleted information went *somewhere*,<br>
  they wouldn't shut up until the scon checked four different disks for the <br>
  missing information.</p>
<p class="words">X-user - &quot;Will you look at those. . .um, that resolution, 
  quite impressive,<br>
  really.&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Using the cutting-edge in graphics technology.<br>
  Disadvantages: Has little or no idea how to use the cutting-edge in graphics<br>
  technology.<br>
  Symptoms: Fuzzy hands, blindness<br>
  Real Case: When I was off duty, two users sat down in front of me at DEC <br>
  station 5000/200s that systems was reconfiguring. I suppressed my laughter<br>
  while, for twenty minutes, they sat down and did their best to act like they 
  <br>
  were doing exectly what they wanted to do, even though they couldn't log in.</p>
<p class="words">Miracle Worker - &quot;But it read a file from it yesterday!&quot; 
  'Sir, at a guess, <br>
  this disk has been swollowed and regurgitated.' &quot;But I did that a month 
  ago,<br>
  and it read a file from it yesterday!&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Apparently has remarkable luck when you aren't around.<br>
  Disadvantages: People complain when scons actually use the word <br>
  'horse-puckey'.<br>
  Symptoms: Loses all ability to do impossible when you're around. Must be <br>
  the kryptonite in your pocket.<br>
  Real Case: At least three users have claimed that they've loaded IBM <br>
  WordPerfect from Macintosh disks.</p>
<p class="words">Taskmaster - &quot;Well, this is a file in MacWrite. Do you know 
  how I can upload<br>
  it to MUSIC, transfer it over to UNIX from there, download it onto an IBM, <br>
  convert it to WordPerfect, and put it in three-column format?&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Bold new challanges.<br>
  Disadvantages: Makes one wish to be a garbage collector.<br>
  Symptoms: An inability to keep quiet. Strong tendancies to make machines <br>
  do things they don't want to do.<br>
  Real Case: One user tried to get a scon to find out what another person's<br>
  E-mail address was even though the user didn't know his target's home system,<br>
  account name, or real name.</p>
<p class="words">Maestro - &quot;Well, first I sat down, like this. Then I logged 
  on, like this,<br>
  and after that, I typed in my password, like this, and after that I edited <br>
  my file, like this, and after that I went to this line here, like this, and<br>
  after that I picked my nose, like this. . .&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Willing to show you exactly what they did to get an error.<br>
  Disadvantages: For as long as five or six hours.<br>
  Symptoms: Selective deafness to the phrases, &quot;Right, right, okay, but what<br>
  was the ERROR?&quot;, and a strong fondness for the phrase, &quot;Well, I'm 
  getting to<br>
  that.&quot;<br>
  Real Case: I once had to spend half an hour looking over a user's shoulder<br>
  while they continuously retrieved a document into itself and denied that they<br>
  did it (the user was complaining that their document was 87 copies of the <br>
  same thing).</p>
<p class="words">Princess (unfair, perhaps, as these tend, overwhelmingly, to 
  be males) - <br>
  &quot;I need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved, would you please<br>
  garrote him and put him in the paper recycling bin?&quot;<br>
  Advantages: Flatters you with their high standards for your service.<br>
  Disadvantages: Impresses you with their obliviousness to other people on <br>
  this planet.<br>
  Symptoms: Inability to communicate except by complaining.<br>
  Real Case: One asked a scon to remove the message of the day because he<br>
  (the user) didn't like it.</p>
