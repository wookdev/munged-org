<p class="words">It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties 
  now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and 
  soon I was more than just a social thinker.</p>
<p class="words">I began to think alone - &quot;to relax,&quot; I told myself 
  - but I knew it wasn't true.</p>
<p class="words">Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I 
  was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking 
  and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.</p>
<p class="words">I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau 
  and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, &quot;What 
  is it exactly we are doing here?&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had 
  turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that 
  night at her mother's.</p>
<p class="words">I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss 
  called me in. He said, &quot; I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your 
  thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll 
  have to find another job.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">This gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p class="words">I came home early after my conversation with the boss. &quot;Honey,&quot; 
  I confessed, &quot;I've been thinking...&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;I know you've been thinking,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
  I want a divorce!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;But Honey, surely it's not that serious.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;It is serious,&quot; she said, lower lip aquiver.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;You think as much as college professors, and college professors 
  don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">&quot;That's a faulty syllogism,&quot; I said impatiently, and 
  she began to cry. I'd had enough. &quot;I'm going to the library,&quot; I snarled 
  as I stomped out the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche. 
  I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't 
  open. The library was closed. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling 
  glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. &quot;Friend, is 
  heavy thinking ruining your life?&quot; it asked. You probably recognize that 
  line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster.</p>
<p class="words">Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never 
  miss a TA meeting.</p>
<p class="words">At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it 
  was &quot;Porky's.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since 
  the last meeting. I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. 
  Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>
