<p class="title"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --> International Sex<!-- #EndEditable --></p> 
<!-- #BeginEditable "words" --> In France and Italy, people seduce each other. 
<p class="words">In Brazil, they don't have seduction, they just have sex, and 
  are laid back about it in a way many uptight Englanders might find loose-moraled.</p>
<p class="words">In Sweden, they don't have seduction either. Any sex that may 
  occur usually happens during a discussion on Third World debt, or the ozone 
  layer, or something equally mind-broadening. Any attempt to seduce a Swede will 
  result in a patronising lecture on safe sex. </p>
<p class="words">In Singapore, they don't have seduction either. Ordinary people 
  live in towering government-built apartment blocks, most of which have a social 
  committee which receives funding from Singapore's government to throw parties 
  to get the socially inept technocrats to socialise and marry and have children 
  to make more Chinese than Malays and Indians (who have a higher birth rate). 
  For the same reason, the National University of Singapore's Engineering faculty 
  is built next to the Accounting department, so the male engineers meet the female 
  accountants, get married, and have Chinese children.</p>
<p class="words">South of Harlem and north of downtown Manhattan, and either side 
  of midtown, is where the rich whites live, and where half the people are too 
  busy to even think about something as frivolous as romance, while the other 
  half are too busy seeing their shrinks because they can't find romance. Anyone 
  they do meet faces a barrage of questions about their career paths, medical 
  insurance plans, and past drug and divorce offenses.</p>
<p class="words">People who live in Connecticut and upstate New York, who commute 
  to Manhattan every day (so-called &quot;mainline snobs&quot; because they never 
  use the subway) seduce each other on the train home, where they scope each other 
  out on the train for a few days, then strike up a conversation a couple of minutes 
  before one of them gets off (so that if the other person is an asshole, the 
  conversation will shortly end anyway) and arrange a lunch date back in Manhattan. 
  This ensures that rich professional mainline snobs mix with other rich professionals. 
</p>
<p class="words">Near (but not in) Washington D.C., in the neighbouring suburbs 
  in Maryland and across the river in Virginia, the first thing single people 
  talk about having met an attractive potential partner is politics. Tax-and-spend 
  liberals won't go out with Dickensian conservatives, gun nuts won't touch screaming 
  heart civil libertarians, lobbiests for oil companies won't date lobbiests for 
  clean air, and all the fine shades of political opinion are more important than 
  opinions about anything else, physical attractiveness, intellectual prowess, 
  and personality. </p>
<p class="words">In Germany, people can talk about their emotions up-front and 
  realistically.</p>
<pre>   SCENE:   Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany<br>   Helmut:  So Hans, how is Helga these days?<br>   Hans:    Helga says that unless I stop sleeping around <br>            and spend more time at home, she's going to <br>            leave me and contest custody of the kids.<br>   Helmut:  I think Helga has a point - if you really loved <br>            her, you wouldn't pay for Eva's flat. <br>   Hans:    The first few years with Helga were great, <br>            but I really don't love her any more. </pre>
<p class="words">People from other cultures find this Teutonic efficiency a little 
  bloodless and dehumanised, as if they discuss their emotions like they discuss 
  their shopping list, or desired options in their new Opel. </p>
<p class="words">In most of Australia, people are afraid to say what they think, 
  for fear of offending someone else and for someone else hurting them. Instead, 
  they talk about safe trivialities. </p>
<pre>   SCENE:   Kensington, NSW<br>   Warren:  So Harry, how is Janet these days?<br>   Harry:   She's been very strange lately. [Tense]<br>   Warren:  Oh? [Nervous tone of voice]<br>   Harry:   Yeah.  <br>   Warren:  [Changing the subject]  How's the new Falcon?<br>   Harry:   It's alright, but typical Australian-made stuff....</pre>
<p class="words">Foreigners are shocked to find that the only way to seduce an 
  Australian is to pretend to be almost completely disinterested. Any show of 
  romantic interest will cause the non-risk-taking Australian to go scurrying 
  of to their friends for security. Any effort to be warm, caring, and supportive 
  to an Australian woman will cause her to reciprocate only because she thinks 
  you must be gay, and thus free of emotional risks.</p>
