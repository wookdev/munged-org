<p class="words">Tis the night before Christmas,&quot; I thought with a frown. 
  <br>
  I was stuck at the office. The network was down.<br>
  The routers were hung in the closet. All crashed. <br>
  Their tables had holes in their data. All trashed. <br>
  Remote distribution, it seems, just for fun,<br>
  Had erased DLLs Windows needed to run <br>
  On 84 desktops way down in accounting.<br>
  I sat stunned at my desk. my blood pressure mounting. </p>
<p class="words">When all of a sudden there arose such a clatter, <br>
  I saw that a server had something the matter.<br>
  There was smoke coming out of the main hard disk drive. <br>
  &quot;No problem, &quot; I thought. &quot;I'm set up with RAID 5. &quot; <br>
  But I found out the system I thought was unstoppable <br>
  Had disk drives that turned out completely unswappable! <br>
  &quot;No problem,&quot; I thought. &quot;I've tape backup to thank. <br>
  And then I discovered my backups were blank.</p>
<p class="words">The UPS burped, and its lights all went out. <br>
  I started to scream! I started to shout! <br>
  But nobody heard as I vented my rage.<br>
  My gurus were all on vacation those days.<br>
  And nobody's tech support answered the phone. <br>
  I was nose deep in trouble, completely alone. <br>
  When out at reception, I heard a soft knock.<br>
  As the hands just touched midnight on my desktop <br>
  clock...</p>
<p class="words">&quot;What's your problem?&quot; he asked.<br>
  &quot;Never mind, friend, I know.<br>
  I checked out your network five hours ago. <br>
  I did some proactive analysis, so<br>
  I knew that this time bomb was going to blow. <br>
  Who was this guy? Who did he think that he was?<br>
  He was dressed in red coveralls, white beard, black <br>
  gloves.</p>
<p class="words">His eyes had the twinkle of technical genius. <br>
  His smile cut down personal distance between us.<br>
  He spread out his tools, and went straight to his work. <br>
  &quot;Whoever configured this network's a jerk,'<br>
  He said with a :-)&gt; as he quickly rebooted, <br>
  Uploaded some software, and smoothly rerouted <br>
  The LAN to a WAN that he quickly supplied <br>
  With bandwidth at least 20 gigabits wide<br>
  That went via wireless, I think, LEO,<br>
  To tech support elves waiting at the North Pole.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Now bridging, now routing, now Ethernet hubs!' <br>
  He chanted as each piece of hardware he rubbed.<br>
  &quot;Cheer up, my good friend! Lose that mindset so tragic! <br>
  Technology often looks just like some magic<br>
  To people who don't understand what we do. <br>
  Now a switch, emulation, now middleware glue! <br>
  Look at the protocols, check one or two,<br>
  Debug a bit, test a bit, presto! We're through!&quot;</p>
<p class="words">My data was back! Every system checked out! <br>
  Tears of joy wet my face as I wandered about. <br>
  &quot;How can I thank you? You must be Saint Nick!&quot;<br>
  He said, 'Really, my friend, it's not such a great trick,<br>
  If you don't give up hope, focus on what you're doing,<br>
  And read all your issues of NETWORK COMPUTING.'<br>
  And I heard him exclaim, as his reindeer were coursing,<br>
  &quot;Merry Christmas to all! And consider outsourcing!</p>
