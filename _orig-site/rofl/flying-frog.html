<h3>A parable about schedules, cycle times, and shaping new behaviors. </h3>
<P class="words">Once upon a time, there lived a man named Clarence who had a 
  pet frog named Felix. Clarence lived a modestly comfortable existence on what 
  he earned working at the Wal-Mart, but he always dreamed of being rich.</P>
<P class="words">&quot;Felix!&quot; he exclaimed one day, &quot;We're going to 
  be rich! I'm going to teach you how to fly!&quot;</P>
<P class="words">Felix, of course, was terrified at the prospect: &quot;I can't 
  fly, you idiot......I'm a frog, not a canary!&quot;</P>
<P class="words">Clarence, disappointed at the initial reaction, told Felix: &quot;That 
  negative attitude of yours could be a real problem. I'm sending you to class.&quot;</P>
<P class="words">So Felix went to a three day class and learned about problem 
  solving, time management, and effective communication.... but nothing about 
  flying.</P>
<P class="words">On the first day of &quot;flying lessons&quot;, Clarence could 
  barely control his excitement (and Felix could barely control his bladder). 
  Clarence explained that their apartment had 15 floors, and each day Felix would 
  jump out of a window starting with the first floor eventually getting to the 
  top floor.</P>
<P class="words">After each jump, Felix would analyze how well he flew, isolate 
  on the most effective flying techniques, and implement the improved process 
  for the next flight. By the time they reached the top floor, Felix would surely 
  be able to fly.</P>
<P class="words">Felix pleaded for his life, but it fell on deaf ears. &quot;He 
  just doesn't understand how important this is...&quot; thought Clarence, &quot;but 
  I won't let nay-sayers get in my way.&quot;</P>
<P class="words">So, with that, Clarence opened the window and threw Felix out 
  (who landed with a thud).</P>
<P class="words">Next day (poised for his second flying lesson) Felix again begged 
  not to be thrown out of the window. With that, Clarence opened his pocket guide 
  to Managing More Effectively and showed Felix the part about how one must always 
  expect resistance when implementing new programs.</P>
<P class="words">And with that, he threw Felix out the window.(THUD)</P>
<P class="words">On the third day (at the third floor) Felix tried a different 
  ploy: stalling, he asked for a delay in the &quot;project&quot; until better 
  weather would make flying conditions more favorable.</P>
<P class="words">But Clarence was ready for him: he produced a timeline and pointed 
  to the third milestone and asked, &quot;You don't want to slip the schedule 
  do you?&quot;</P>
<P class="words">From his training, Felix knew that not jumping today would mean 
  that he would have to jump TWICE tomorrow.... so he just said: &quot;OK. Let's 
  go.&quot;</P>
<P class="words">And out the window he went.</P>
<P class="words">Now this is not to say that Felix wasn't trying his best. On 
  the fifth day he flapped his feet madly in a vain attempt to fly. On the sixth 
  day he tied a small red cape around his neck and tried to think &quot;Superman&quot; 
  thoughts.</P>
<P class="words">But try as he might, he couldn't fly.</P>
<P class="words">By the seventh day, Felix (accepting his fate) no longer begged 
  for mercy.... he simply looked at Clarence and said: &quot;You know you're killing 
  me, don't you?&quot;</P>
<P class="words">Clarence pointed out that Felix's performance so far had been 
  less than exemplary, failing to meet any of the milestone goals he had set for 
  him.</P>
<P class="words">With that, Felix said quietly: &quot;Shut up and open the window,&quot; 
  and he leaped out, taking careful aim on the large jagged rock by the corner 
  of the building.</P>
<P class="words">And Felix went to that great lily pad in the sky.</P>
<P class="words">Clarence was extremely upset, as his project had failed to meet 
  a single goal that he set out to accomplish. Felix had not only failed to fly, 
  he didn't even learn how to steer his flight as he fell like a sack of cement.... 
  nor did he improve his productivity when Clarence had told him to &quot;Fall 
  smarter, not harder.&quot;</P>
<P class="words">The only thing left for Clarence to do was to analyze the process 
  and try to determine where it had gone wrong.</P>
<P class="words">After much thought, Clarence smiled and said:</P>
<P class="words">&quot;Next time...... I'm getting a smarter frog!&quot; </P>
