  to Explain Why You Might Want One<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

<p class="words">My friend DaveO (a TiVo owner) told me an interesting story the 
  last time I visited him. The first TiVo he had developed a problem. He called 
  TiVo support, and they determined it was a hard drive controller problem and 
  the unit would have to go back to TiVo for repair. This would take a couple 
  of weeks. DaveO put the phone down and told his wife &quot;Get in the car, we're 
  going to buy a new one.&quot;</p>
<p class="words">The TiVo is an interesting thing. Those who don't have one do 
  not understand why they might want it. Those who have one, can't imagine life 
  without it. My friend DaveO is not the only TiVo owner I know of that will go 
  so far as to spend $400 to get a new TiVo rather than do without one for a couple 
  of weeks for repairs.</p>
<p class="words">Conversion to the TiVo faithful is quick. I had of course heard 
  of TiVo, and Replay TV, and the others, and thought they were a cool idea, but 
  I couldn't see myself actually benefiting from one, because I don't watch TV. 
  Then I stayed with DaveO for a week in December last year, and again for Super 
  Bowl weekend this year. I was hooked, and I didn't even own one yet.</p>
<p class="words"> I can't imagine not having one. I couldn't imagine not having 
  one only 1 day after it arrived.</p>
<p class="words">Why can't I live without this thing? Let me give you an example: 
  Last night when &quot;ER&quot; came on, I realized that I was pretty hungry, 
  so I went into the kitchen and made myself something to eat. When I came back 
  to the living room and the TV 20 minutes later, I'd missed the first part of 
  ER. So I hit the &quot;RW&quot; button on the TiVo remote, and went back to 
  the beginning of ER. The TiVo was still recording &quot;ER&quot; as it happened, 
  20 minutes ahead of what I was watching. Because I was effectively 20 minutes 
  behind, I could fast forward through the commercials.</p>
<p class="words">So, exactly what is a TiVo?</p>
<p class="words">&quot;The Industry&quot; refers to it as a &quot;DVR&quot;, for 
  &quot;Digital Video Recorder&quot;. TiVo calls it a &quot;PVR&quot;, for &quot;Personal 
  Video Recorder&quot;. A DVR lives in the same spot your VCR does in the grand 
  scheme of watching things on your television. They are basically a VCR-sized 
  box with a computer and TV receiver built in. It records TV shows to a hard 
  drive, and can play them back later. Just like a VCR. Only the recording doesn't 
  go on a tape cassette, but instead onto a computer hard drive. The remote control 
  is just like a VCR remote, with pretty much the same buttons. The TiVo box itself 
  looks kind of like a VCR, it just doesn't have a slot for a tape on the front.</p>
<p class="words">Why you might want one has to do with the extra features the 
  flexibility of the computer/hard drive gives that you don't get with a VHS tape. 
  The TiVo can record one TV show at a time, just like a VCR. It can play one 
  recorded show off the hard drive at a time. It can do both of those things at 
  the same time, but the show it is playing doesn't have to be the same show it 
  is recording. That isn't possible with a VCR using a tape. Tonight, my TiVo 
  was recording an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; while I was watching a &quot;Law 
  &amp; Order&quot; I'd told it to record earlier. You'd need two VCR's to do 
  this without a TiVo.</p>
<p class="words">It is also always recording whatever station you happen to be 
  watching. It records everything from the last time the channel was changed, 
  though it will only keep the last half hour. You can tell it to record a show 
  you are watching if you need more than a half hour. If you are watching a show, 
  and 15 minutes into it, you decide you really want it recorded for later. You 
  push the record button, and just like a VCR, it will start recording. But unlike 
  a VCR, because is has been recording the last half-hour, it will include that 
  in the recording, and you will get the whole show.</p>
<p class="words">You can also tell TiVo that you want to record shows in advance 
  of them being on, just like a VCR. You can record a single show, or a show at 
  a specific time every day/week/whatever, or you can set it up to record every 
  instance of a show on a single station no matter when, or how often, it might 
  be on. Pretty much like a VCR.</p>
<p class="words">The other advantage of TiVo is the Guide. Those who have satellite 
  TV or digital cable will understand why this is good, and basically how it works. 
  Rather than just a scrolling list of what is on each channel for the next 90 
  minutes, it is an interactive guide, that you can move around in at will. TiVo 
  has roughly 2 weeks of guide in advance, so you can check out what will be on 
  to record. The Guide is updated once a night, when the TiVo dials a local number 
  to download updates.</p>
<p class="words">The real advantage of a DVR is just how easy it is to deal with. 
  No more worrying about having room on a tape, or that a show you haven't watched 
  yet will get recorded over. The TiVo handles this, and can record far more on 
  its disk drive than a single tape ever will, depending on what the capacity 
  of your TiVo actually is. Also, on a VCR, a new recording can not be made when 
  you are watching a previously recorded show. The TiVo can record while it is 
  playing something previously recorded, so this isn't a problem.</p>
<p class="words">I've owned a VCR since I moved to New York, and never once did 
  I record anything to watch later. The hassle was never worth it to me. Rob did 
  while we lived together, but he is much more serious about TV, in the guise 
  of keeping up on popular culture, than I ever will be. For people like Rob who 
  record things to keep forever, the TiVo has a &quot;record to tape&quot; option 
  that plays a show back with all the &quot;pop-up stuff&quot; disabled so that 
  you won't see the guide or something right in the middle of your tape.</p>
<p class="words">I've actually started watching more TV since I got the TiVo. 
  But I do not watch &quot;live&quot; TV any more. I wait for the Tivo to record 
  it, and watch it when I want to. Most of what I like to watch isn't really on 
  when I want to watch it. But now, with TiVo, it is on exactly when I want to 
  watch it.</p>
<p class="words">TV is not a bad thing, if and of itself. What is bad about it 
  is that amount of time that is wasted watching things you don't care to, because 
  nothing you want to watch is playing. Some people just give up on it, and that 
  is fine. But I enjoy the cheap entertainment, and some of what is out there 
  is of exceptional quality.</p>
<p class="words">It is a waste to not use any tool to your advantage. And for 
  TV, a DVR, in the form of my Tivo, is the perfect tool for the job.</p>
