<h3>Pessimism</h3>

<p>Advantages of being a pessimist:</p>

<p>When you expect that everything is going to hell, you aren't so disappointed 
  when things actually do.</p>

<p>Pessimists are realists. The second law of thermodynamics, commonly referred 
  to as "entropy", basically says that everything is going to go to hell eventually.</p>

<p>Optimism is just setting yourself up for a major disappointment... over and
over and over...</p>
