<p class="words">Or: I Went To DemiCon and All I Got Was 800 Crappy-Looking Photos</p>
<p class="words">Yes, you read the title right, I said &quot;hell&quot;. After 
  writing in the <a href="http://www.munged.org/saga/165.html">journal entry</a> 
  about how I was switching from film photography back to digital because of the 
  problem of getting good pictures, you have to be wondering what I'm bitching 
  about now. And I have an answer for you.</p>
<p class="words">In a word: &quot;White Ballance&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">Okay, so that's two words, so sue me.</p>
<p class="words">You have to ask yourself when you are taking pictures with any 
  kind of camera, film or digital, video or still: &quot;What color is that white 
  thing, really?&quot; I'm not kidding. It looks white to you, because your brain 
  has grown up knowing that white is white, and when it sees something that it 
  knows is <strong>supposed</strong> to be white, your brain adjusts your perception 
  so that what you <strong>think</strong> you see is white.</p>
<p class="words">We learn in art and physics classes that white is really a color 
  that is made by reflecting all colors equally. But what if the light that is 
  being reflected equally has more blue in it than red or green? You will see 
  a blueish-white thing, or a light blue thing. Your brain though, will &quot;color 
  correct&quot; to be white.</p>
<p class="words">Once you know what you are looking for, you can actually see 
  this. On a bright, clear, summer day at noon, find a tree or something that 
  provides complete shade. Stand in the shade, and look at a piece of paper or 
  something that is white. At first, you will see white. But look closely, and 
  you will realize that the piece of paper is actually a light blue. This is because 
  the nice &quot;white&quot; light comming directly from the sun is blocked by 
  whatever is creating the shade, and the piece of paper is actually being lit 
  by the blue sky all around (we said a &quot;clear&quot; day above, which should 
  be read: &quot;no clouds&quot;).</p>
<p class="words">This is white ballance, an effort to define what color a white 
  object will actually be, and correct it so that it will look white. This is 
  important, because digital cameras, and film cameras for that matter, don't 
  have a brain like yours. They will put on film, or record digitally, what color 
  something really is with zero regard to your brains sensibilities about what 
  white really looks like.</p>
<p class="words">Thus it is, when you take a night shot of street lights, they 
  all come out green. When you take pictures lit by incandescent lighting, every 
  shot comes out redish-orange.</p>
<p class="words">In a effort to comensate for this effect, some scientist somewhere 
  defined a &quot;color tempurature&quot; scale, so that they could specify what 
  &quot;tempurature&quot; the light was, and adjust for that &quot;tempurature&quot; 
  so that white looks like white. The idea is to take a blackbody radiator and 
  heat it up, and record what tempurature it has to be to radiate &quot;white 
  light&quot;, or variations on the theme. Color temp is specified in degrees 
  kelvin. If you don't remember highschool physics, kelvin is like celcius, but 
  0 is at absolute zero, or -273 degrees celcius.</p>
<p class="words">Now, &quot;white light&quot; still needs to be defined, so what 
  happened is that someone -- probably an intern -- got sent to Washington DC 
  on a bright, clear, summer day, stand on the Plaza there at exactly noon, and 
  recorded the light coming down, and called that light &quot;white light&quot;, 
  which turned out to be 5500 degrees kelvin. Meaning that it is totally arbitrary.</p>
<p class="words">But, 5500K is still an important number, because &quot;color 
  corrected light&quot; in a photographic sense is 5500K, and most speedlights, 
  strobes, and flash kits are going to be calibrated to pump out that kind of 
  light.</p>
<p class="words">But as with many things in this world, not all is as it seems. 
  In photography, &quot;warm colors&quot; are redish, and &quot;cold colors&quot; 
  are blueish. But warm colors are color temps that are below 5500K, which normal 
  people would think of as a &quot;cooler temp&quot;, and cool colors are colors 
  above 5500K, which normal people would think of at hotter. I will not try to 
  explain this one.</p>
<p class="words">So, what to do? As I pointed out above, even film suffers from 
  white balance problems. Film is designed to look good in a specific color temp. 
  You will often see &quot;Daylight&quot; film, or &quot;Tungsten&quot; film. 
  Daylight film is film designed to render color temps of 5500K to 6000K as pure 
  white, and Tengsten film will render color temps around 3200K as white. Florescent 
  lights don't fit into this scheme really well, they are not blackbody radiators, 
  and radiate light in rather specific narrow bandwidths.</p>
<p class="words">Photographers traditionally get along with this color temp thing 
  by carrying around a small collection of filters designed to turn whatever light 
  they have into 5500K light.</p>
<p class="words">In the digital world though, we have the chance to do this adjustment 
  on the fly as the camera records the picture. The CCD or CMOS sensor that actually 
  records the picture doesn't know, natively, what white actually is, like film 
  does. It just records a bunch of numbers, and the computer in the camera adjusts 
  them in whatever way it sees fit for &quot;white balance&quot;, and puts the 
  result on the memory card. Most digital cameras have a way of setting the &quot;white 
  balance&quot;, or have a &quot;auto&quot; setting that will calculate it on 
  the fly. While digital cameras have gotten pretty good at this, they all still 
  have a certain amount of trouble with incandescent and tungsten lighting.</p>
<p class="words">My Nikon D100 got almost every picture wrong that didn't get 
  taken with flash. The color temps in most of the rooms was somewhere around 
  2500K, which is probably the result of using a zillion, clear, 40 Watt light 
  bulbs in the chandeliers.</p>
<p class="words">In our next installment, I'll go into exactly how I've been getting 
  reasonable pictures out of a bunch of orange photos.</p>
