<p class="words">Isn't &quot;Mac OS X 10.1.3&quot; redundant? Or should it really 
  be: &quot;Mac OS X.1.3&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">Whatever.</p>
<p class="words">I should start by saying that this isn't a serious review, and 
  if you do what I did, you are as insane as I am. I'd recommend you not read 
  this until you've actually upgraded. That way, I can't be blamed when the whole 
  process pukes on your shoes.</p>
<p class="words">I started my road to OS X with my trusty iMac DV, and a total 
  belief that I was going to totally trash that iMac, and violate a &quot;Rule 
  1&quot;. <a href="iMac.html">We've covered this before</a>. I needn't go into 
  it again.</p>
<p class="words">The iMac had Mac OS 9.1.x on it, with a very healthy list of 
  INITs and other startup docs. It has a 9 Gig drive that is internal, plus a 
  80 Gig external, firewire, drive.</p>
<p class="words">Apple says in the README that OS X will work with OS 9.1.x, but 
  they recommend upgrading to 9.2.2, which is an upgrade that fixed compatibility 
  issues running with OS X.</p>
<p class="words">So, step one: Upgrade OS 9 to 9.2.2. OS X ships with an OS 9.2.2 
  CD. Should be a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="words">I made some backups. I made a copy of the System folder on the 
  internal drive, and also a copy on the external drive. I booted to both of them 
  to make sure they worked. Then I copied my photo and docs directories to each 
  drive, to minimize damage in case I felt a need to push &quot;format&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">I put the OS 9 CD in, and booted from it. I selected to upgrade 
  my current hard drive, choose to install a new System folder. (I'm pretty sure 
  that was an option, and that I used it. I'm to lazy to check now.) After that 
  was done, I booted from that new System folder. I reinstalled an updated Conflict 
  Catcher in the new system folder, and used its ability to merge system folders 
  to recover all the other INITs I needed to make the printer, scanner, pilot, 
  and assorted other crap work.</p>
<p class="words">That was it. I reset some of options in assorted control panels, 
  and ran everything to make sure it worked. It all did.</p>
<p class="words">Next was OS X.</p>
<p class="words">The install for OS X works much like the one for OS 9. A couple 
  of minor differences really are minor. For instance, you can't choose to format 
  the disk you are installing to, because OS 9 must already be there for OS X 
  to work. The one thing that might be different, is that you must choose a username 
  and password for an admin. user. OS X is a multi-user OS (at least in theory), 
  and &quot;Multiple Users&quot; is no longer something you turn on like in OS 
  9. It just is.</p>
<p class="words">I choose to install almost everything, except language packs 
  I didn't need. I doubt I will suddenly be speaking Korean any time soon, so 
  I didn't install it.</p>
<p class="words">When the install was over, the machine reboots into OS X. The 
  computer starts up with the same &quot;Happy Mac&quot; that it always has. But 
  almost instantly after you see, it, the cursor changes from the OS 9 &quot;waiting&quot; 
  symbol, so the colorful spinning disk that OS X uses. Then you see the OS X 
  splash screen, and finally the Aqua desktop.</p>
<p class="words">It isn't THAT different. There are still disk drive icons in 
  the upper right hand corner of the desktop area. They use the same &quot;swoopy&quot; 
  backdrops that cause blindness in lab rats. The menu bar is still at the top 
  of the screen. There is still an apple menu.</p>
<p class="words">Anyone that has used a Mac running Mac OS 9, will be able to 
  use Aqua.</p>
<p class="words">After poking around for a while, I ran Software Update, which 
  updated me to 10.1.2.</p>
<p class="words">OS X 10.1, which came on the CD, and 10.1.2 from the update, 
  doesn't have any drivers for my Epson ColorStylus 900. But, looky, Epson has 
  downloadable drivers on their web site. So I could print.</p>
<p class="words">HP doesn't have OS X scanner drivers. Netscape doesn't have an 
  OS X version of the stable Navigator 4.7x. OS X version of MS Office (called 
  Office v.X, which I find humorous) will be out soon. Palm doesn't have an OS 
  X version of the Palm Desktop. There is one in beta, but it won't run with Classic 
  running, which is a problem, since none of the programs I use most have been 
  ported yet and will be running in classic. This is not a huge problem, since 
  I haven't been able to hotsync without a major hassle in a very long time, so 
  I don't do it often.</p>
<p class="words">Interestingly enough, FileMaker does have an OS X version, but 
  I haven't put it on the system yet.</p>
<p class="words">Apple Mail is a simple mail program that has some cool features. 
  So far it is doing fine.</p>
<p class="words">After a while, I found Terminal. Oh baby. UNIX. There is even 
  ssh in here. I moved my OpenSSH keys from my laptop, and I'm tested SSHing into 
  each of the servers on the net I have set up. Very cool.</p>
<p class="words">More on how I get along later.</p>
