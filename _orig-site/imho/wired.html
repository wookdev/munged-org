<h1>Wired Magazine</h1>

<p>We happened to pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired Magazine</a>
recently in a airport.  It was interesting, including the details of how they made the
previous cover change colors when it was touched.</p>

<p>The part that was interesting was actually more to do with what wasn't in the
magazine.  Despite claiming to be a magazine for the "wired generation" or whatnot
(that is my quote, not theirs since I'm to lazy to actually look this up), it looked
more like Playboy, but without the T&A.  The major difference between the two as far
as I can tell, is that it is actually possible to differentiate the ads from the content
in Playboy.</p>

<p>If there is a defense for Wired, it could possibly be that the net has so invaded
pop culture, or maybe vise-versa, that it isn't possible for Wired to look any 
different than it does.  Sex sells, as does over-the-top graphics, it would seem.
The techno culture likes a perverted kind of cool, and flash can often fool the masses.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
