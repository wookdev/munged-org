<p class="words">I've always wanted a pair of Dunlavy speakers for my stereo.</p>
<p class="words">Actually, I've wanted them since I was in high school, when the 
  company name was Duntech, and the speakers were called &quot;Odyssey 2001&quot;. 
  Built by a man by the name of Dunlavy, who is an expert at designing microwave 
  antennas. He used his expertise in that to design the perfect stereo speakers. 
  The Odyssey 2001 speakers had very impressive numbers. They were reported to 
  have awesome sound and the ability to fill a room with thundering bass and delicately 
  transparent highs.</p>
<p class="words">Then I lost track of Duntech.</p>
<p class="words">15 years later, I was in <a href="http://www.audio-logic.com/">Audio-Video 
  Logic</a> in Des Moines (hereafter: <a href="http://www.audio-logic.com/">AVL</a>) 
  with my friend Dave M. AVL is a very high-end store. I related how the speakers 
  I wanted were called Odyssey 2001, and wondered what happened to the company 
  that made them, the name of which started with Dun&lt;something&gt;.</p>
<p class="words">AVL is a Dunlavy distributor it turns out. So Dave, his wife 
  Jaime, and I spent an hour or two listening to the incredible Dunlavy Audio 
  Labs, SC-IVa speakers. I was hooked.</p>
<p class="words">Time passed, other priorities were taken care of of. Dave purchased 
  a pair of Dunlavy SC-III speakers. [Dave says: &quot;It was more like Jaime 
  insisted and I went along for the ride (not that I'm complaining).&quot;</p>
<p class="words">Then I received an email from Dave. In it, he told me that Dunlavy 
  was out of business, and that AVL had some of the last speakers, and was negotiating 
  to pick up all the remaining stock.</p>
<p class="words">So, I called them, to find out what they had. I put a deposit 
  down on a demo pair of SC-IVa speakers in dark cherry wood. I would stop into 
  AVL in January, a few weeks later, when I was in Des Moines to conclude the 
  transaction.</p>
<p class="words">So anyway, the speakers arrived on Monday. There were in four 
  boxes. Two were the stands, in boxes the size of three pizza boxes stacked on 
  top of each other. The other two boxes took up all available space in my living 
  room. More than six and a half feet tall, and a foot by a foot and a half in 
  cross-section, 200 pounds each shipping weight. I stood there looking at the 
  boxes, feeling like one of the apes in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, looking 
  at the monolith.</p>
<p class="words">I called AVL, and got some advise from Denny on putting them 
  together. The secret is a phone book under the lower end, to hold it up while 
  attaching the bases. Also, while I was on the phone with Denny, I ordered some 
  <a href="http://www.nordost.com/products/flatline.html">Super Flatline MkII</a> 
  speaker connects, because I realized the stuff I've been using is in very bad 
  shape. Robert came over that afternoon, and helped me put them together and 
  plug them in. We also had to move some things around a little, since these things 
  kind of change the landscape at the &quot;media&quot; end of my living room.</p>
<p class="words">Even with the crappy speaker cable, these speakers sound Really 
  Good. I mean, REALLY GOOD. Amazing. So good, that Rob and I had a problem finding 
  a CD in my collection that would truly do them justice. So much of pop music 
  is recorded and mastered incredibly badly, even in this day and age of digital 
  reproduction. We finally settled on old standards: Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh 
  Aire IV, and 8, and the Holly Cole Trio's &quot;Don't Smoke In Bed&quot;.</p>
<p class="words">&quot;Fresh Aire IV&quot; turned out to be disappointing. It 
  was recorded 20 years ago or so, and at the time it was very well done. Chip 
  Davis originally put his Fresh Air albums on LPs that were such high quality 
  that you could tell them apart by how much heavier they were than a &quot;normal&quot; 
  vinyl LP. On most of my previous stereos, the pipe organ on the beginning of 
  this disk was the starting point for evaluating bass response.</p>
<p class="words">Now, &quot;Fresh Aire IV&quot; suffered, badly. There was little 
  in the actual low end, though you could tell it was supposed to be there. The 
  pipe organ was not what I was hoping it would be.</p>
<p class="words">So we moved on to &quot;Fresh Air 8&quot;. This is fairly recent, 
  and very well recorded and mastered onto CD. It is a good test because it is 
  orchestral, choral, and includes electronic instruments in with the ones nature 
  came up with. It is a complex work, with lots of chances for the speakers to 
  show their capabilities. It is probably the second best sounding thing I've 
  got. It sounded fantastic. It had bass. It had treble. It had space. It had 
  sound-stage. At no time did any part of the recording &quot;get lost&quot; in 
  any other part. I've listened to this one about 8 time since that first evaluation 
  with Rob.</p>
<p class="words">The Holly Cole Trio is a stand-up bass, a piano, and Holly Cole's 
  incredible voice. The first track of &quot;Don't Smoke In Bed&quot; is &quot;I 
  Can See Clearly Now&quot;. It starts with just the stand-up bass. On these speakers, 
  that bass is real. You can hear it resonate. You can hear the musician's fingers 
  on the strings, and tell the difference in sounds when he is going fast, or 
  has time to pluck the strings carefully. You can hear his hand slide along the 
  frets as it changes position for a different note. You can also walk around 
  the room while that bass is playing, and hear very plainly where the room itself 
  has problems. More on that later.</p>
<p class="words">Dire Straits's, self-titled CD was simply disappointing, sound-wise. 
  Rob commented that he'd always thought of their stuff as having been well recorded. 
  And once upon a time, it probably was.</p>
<p class="words">Since that first day, I've put a few other things in. Dave Matthews 
  Band, &quot;Crash&quot; is well done. The guitar on &quot;So Much To Say&quot; 
  is well recorded, and just enjoyable in general. And &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot; 
  in addition to being a general favorite, just causes me to sit down and drift 
  while I listen.</p>
<p class="words">While playing U2's &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; I found a bass nodal 
  point in my kitchen. This one has a lot of bass, presumably so even people without 
  rhythm can dance to it. The spot is when standing right between the sink and 
  stove. In that spot, the bass of this CD was flexing my stomach for me.</p>
<p class="words">I'm saying a lot about bass response in this missive. My previous 
  speakers, Energy 2.1e speakers, handled the high end pretty well. It is easy 
  for small speakers to do good highs, simply because the best drivers for the 
  high end are small, so they can be very fast for high-end reproduction. We all 
  know what a tweeter looks like, right? The SC-IVa are doing just as incredible 
  on the full musical range as they are in the bass.</p>
<p class="words">In fact, after listening to them for a week, I started to think 
  that the bass was over-done. On friday, the speaker cables arrived from AVL 
  via UPS. Yesterday, I changed from the NAD 216 to the Marantz MA-700 monoblocks, 
  and put in the Nordost cables. Now the bass is controlled well, and not overpowering, 
  even on the U2 stuff, and Fresh Air 8. Holly Cole, oddly enough, sounds pretty 
  much the same, though the bass suffers less from ugly resonances in some places. 
  I think I'll keep this setup, though I should probably put the NAD back in with 
  the new cables just to see what their contribution actually is.</p>
<p class="words">The biggest change to my life is that I enjoy listening to music 
  in my apartment now. This is new. My living room is highly reflective to sound, 
  because there is very little dampening material. The bare walls and floor cause 
  the highs to be somewhat shrill, and lows weren't reinforced at all by the room. 
  The Energy 2.1e setup was never able to overcome this. Music always sounded 
  overly bright and devoid of anything resembling &quot;bottom&quot;. So I would 
  put in music and then wander away from it.</p>
<p class="words">During my copious free time (ha!), I've been stuck in my love 
  seat in front of the Dunlavy's since Monday, and have missed TV shows I like 
  to watch, because I've got some music in that I want to enjoy. (TiVo will record 
  that TV I want to watch, anyway.) The only reason I've been able to go to work 
  is that if I play music all night long or to early in the morning, I will be 
  evicted. I have enough willpower to avoid that.</p>
<p class="words">Still, you never know. The first time I played something, both 
  Robert and I thought I'd set the volume at a nice, normal, level. Then we found 
  we had to yell to be heard when we tried to talk. In lesser speakers, one of 
  the signs of loud is distortion. When the music is fuzzy, it must be loud. But 
  the SC-IVa's do not get distorted at volume. At least, at no volume I've been 
  willing to push so far. I've got a mental mark on the volume control, above 
  which I will not venture, in an attempt to remain a resident of this apartment.</p>
<p class="words">I haven't really done much with DVDs yet. Because I only have 
  a two-channel setup, I really can't take advantage of 5.1 Dolby Digital (AC-3) 
  or DTS 5.1 or 6.1. I'm going to have to fix this little problem, since I do 
  now have enough speakers to make a 4-chanel system. I also ordered some <a href="http://www.superbitdvd.com/">Superbit 
  DVDs</a>, which should be pretty cool. I keep looking at the AVL website, thinking 
  that two more pairs of SC-IIa speakers are affordable. I probably know where 
  to get 4 more MA-700 amplifiers cheap too.</p>
<p class="words">But that is all for the future. Right now, here's to music.</p>
