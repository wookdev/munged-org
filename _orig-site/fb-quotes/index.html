<p>These are things people said on Facebook that made us laugh out loud.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of things here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full posts with or without comments</li>
  <li>Comments taken out of context</li>
</ul>
<p>They will not be really marked as such. But we figured the gentle readers should be warned.</p>
<p>Newer entries are at the top, tho they are not always in order.</p>
