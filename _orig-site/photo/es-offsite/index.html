That was also my       first day in ES.</p>    <p>I thought these pictures were lost, because I couldn't find the Compact       Flash memory card that held these pictures.  It was the original one I'd       received with the camera, and I'd replaced it with a newer, bigger, CF       card, and stopped using the one that held these pictures. Then, I lost       track of the old CF card.</p>    <p>As it turns out, I'd placed the CF card in a deep pocket of my computer       bag.  I was reaching blindly into my computer bag last week, and rather        than my Pilot, I pulled out the CF card.</p>    <p>So here are the pictures of that event.</p>    <p>Enjoy.</p>    <h3>The fuzzy hat pictures:</h3>    <p>The hat is a Cisco hat. ET picked it up at a thing he did with Cisco. And he   brought the hat to the offsite, where I took pictures of people wearing it.</p>    <table>      <tr>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="fuzz-head-et.html"> <img src="tn/tn.fuzz-head-et.png" alt="ET looking silly."></a></p>      <a href="fuzz-head-et.html">       <p align=center>ET looking silly.</p></a>        </td>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="fuzz-head-jon.html"> <img src="tn/tn.fuzz-head-jon.png" alt="Jon looking silly."></a></p>      <a href="fuzz-head-jon.html">       <p align=center>Jon looking silly.</p></a>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    <h3>The standing on chair pictures:</h3>    <p>We had written up a mission statement (I think?), and presented them from our chairs.</p>    <table>      <tr>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="on-chair-marc.html"> <img src="tn/tn.on-chair-marc.png" alt="Marc on a chair, looking silly."></a></p>      <a href="on-chair-marc.html">       <p align=center>Marc on a chair, looking silly.</p></a>        </td>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="on-chair-nick.html"> <img src="tn/tn.on-chair-nick.png" alt="Nick on a chair, looking silly."></a></p>      <a href="on-chair-nick.html">       <p align=center>Nick on a chair, looking silly.</p></a>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    <h3>Assorted Shots</h3>    <p>Just assorted shots before we get to the blackmail pictures.</p>    <table>      <tr>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="marc-presenting.html"> <img src="tn/tn.marc-surly.png" alt="Marc at the board."></a></p>      <a href="marc-presenting.html">       <p align=center>Kinda looks like he's going to throw that pen at                me.

Shame the camera battery died when       I was trying to get a picture of her, but it isn't such a disaster, since she       still wears them on occasion.</p>    <table>      <tr>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="leather-jon.html"> <img src="tn/tn.leather-jon.png" alt="Jon in leather."></a></p>      <a href="leather-jon.html">       <p align=center>Rock Star Jon</p>      </a>        </td>        <td>                <p align=center><a href="leather-nick.html"> <img src="tn/tn.leather-nick.png" alt="Nick in leather."></a></p>      <a href="leather-nick.html">       <p align=center>Rock Star Nick</p>      </a></td>      </tr>    </table>  </body></html>
