On a Saturday, Ray and I joined up with Henry and Lenny from Predictive.        <p>Here they are on London Bridge.</td> <td align="center"><a name="1.html"></a><a href="/photo/riv-assorted/Pages/1.html"><img width="120" height="90" src="/photo/riv-assorted/Thumbs/1.jpg" alt="thumbnail"></a> <br>        Again, London 1999. We were walking around, and ran into the London Smith         Barney office. I'd just quit from Smith Barney in New York. For some reason,         taking this picture seemed like a good idea at the time.</td> <td align="center"><a name="2.html"></a><a href="/photo/riv-assorted/Pages/2.html"><img width="90" height="120" src="/photo/riv-assorted/Thumbs/2.jpg" alt="thumbnail"></a> <br>Later that night, in a &quot;London Shut In" at a pub that Helen later told me she never went back to, she is caught being a good officer, and delivering beer. </td> <td align="center"><a name="3.html"></a><a href="/photo/riv-assorted/Pages/3.html"><img width="120" height="90" src="/photo/riv-assorted/Thumbs/3.jpg" alt="thumbnail"></a> <br>        Not the whole gang that was out that night, but the most people in a single         picture that was in focus. Oddly enough, the pictures got fuzzier as the         night progressed. And I thought it was just me.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><a name="4.html"></a><a href="/photo/riv-assorted/Pages/4.html"><img width="90" height="120" src="/photo/riv-assorted/Thumbs/4.jpg" alt="thumbnail"></a> <br>        Fast forward a bit, to last year.

We took him to Emeril's           restaurant with us, they took one look at him and got a high-chair.           It was perfect.       </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><a name="8.html"></a><a href="/photo/riv-assorted/Pages/8.html"><img width="120" height="90" src="/photo/riv-assorted/Thumbs/8.jpg" alt="thumbnail"></a> <br>        Taber Manning got married late last year, and a small group of us went         to Vegas for the bachelor party.
