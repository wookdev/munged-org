<h1>Where is Wook</h1>
<h3>Thursday, January 24, 2002</h3>
<p>Not doing very well on keeping this updated, am I? I should also probably move 
  it to a web site that is a little more out of the way, so that I'm not announcing 
  the fact I'm not home to a site that is THIS public.</p>
<p>Anyway, was in Britain again, since a week ago Wednesday, which is, oh, lets 
  see... the 16th. I just got back.</p>
<p>RiverSoft is getting me a &quot;Multiple Entry Work Permit&quot; for the UK. 
  I'm over there often enough that it will be a good thing. I'm not sure what 
  all the ramifications are, but it does mean I can be there as often, and as 
  long, as I want. The only limitation on my time spent in that country will be 
  if I'm there more than 183 days, I have to pay UK income taxes. (Yeek!)</p>
<p>I found out that the UK government body responsible for taxes is also the IRS. 
  It stands for &quot;Inland Revenue Service&quot; though, and seems to usually 
  be called &quot;Inland Revenue&quot; rather than the abreviation.</p>
<p>My trusty old Dell laptop is starting to flake out again, screen-wise. The 
  backlight for the LCD display doesn't always come on, leaving the screen dark 
  (off, basically). If I hit the cover just above the hinges, it comes back. It 
  was doing this really bad at one point, and hasn't really been a problem lately. 
  Twice in a day today. Still, I've had really good luck with a laptop that will 
  be 3 in April.</p>
<h3>Monday, January 7, 2002</h3>
<p>Just got back from the new years eve party. Back to the grind. I'm in NYC for 
  the time being.</p>
<h3>Friday, December 21, 2001</h3>
<p>Well, back home, again. Two whole days this time. More or less. I drive to 
  Pittsburgh on Sunday for Xmas.</p>
<h3>Tuesday, December 11, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm home in NYC as I type this. The date above says Tuesday but in fact I'm 
  still on Monday.</p>
<p>I leave for London tomorrow. I was supposed to leave today, but I missed my 
  flight home from San Francisco, thus missing my flight to London this morning.</p>
<p>I return to the States just before Christmas.</p>
<h3>Wednesday, November 28, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm in Yosemite tonight.  This is my last day here, but it is snowing, and 
it is supposed to drop a lot of snow on us.  We shall see.  If it does, I might
be stuck here until it clears.  Planning on leaving tomorrow to go to Death Valley
and poke around there.  Then on to Las Vegas, arriving on Sunday night for four
days.  I return to NYC on the 9th, and on to London on the 10th.</p>
<p>Today is my birthday. It has been a good day: First hike around the Yosemite 
  Valley floor, seeing beautiful stuff, take a tour and see other stuff, get a 
  massage, a perfect steak dinner, and then hang out with a bunch (30 or so) of 
  the locals/staff of the places around here.</p>
<p>All in all, a good day, and a very good week.</p>
<h3>Wednesday, November 21, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm home today, but I fly tonight to San Francisco to spend Thanksgiving with 
  some friends. Then I'm off to drive around in the desert Southwest US for a 
  while, with a stop in Las Vegas. I return home on the 9th of December.</p>
