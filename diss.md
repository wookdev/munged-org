## I shouldn't need to say any of this, but there's something wrong with
way to many people these days, so here we go:

### Warning:

This site is mine. Thus, the choice of content to put on this site is mine.
I do not, and will not, consider anyone's views, beliefs, mores, or desires
when I make choices of content to put on this site.

I like stuff that will offend you, no matter who you are. I don't care what
you think of any of it. This site is not posted for the common good, and contains
no essential information that can not be found elsewhere, so there is no reason
why you should ever look at this site if you find it offensive.
### Disclaimer:

All the content on this site represents either my sense of humor, my sense
of curiosity, or my sense of wonder. Note that I have not claimed that any
of this content represents my views. Some of it doesn't represent my views.
It doesn't represent the views of anyone else, either; not my employer, not
my family, and certainly not you.

All the material I put on this site is presented with heart-felt sincerity.
However, some of that material will be wrong or even dangerous. You must take
responsibility for yourself. That means independently verifying anything on
this site you read. I am not responsible for the results of your actions.
If you get yourself offended, hurt, killed, or suffer any of the other millions
of sub-optimal results of stupidity, it is entirely your fault.

### The Rules:

You MAY NOT VISIT THIS SITE or any pages linked to from this site. This site
is for my use, and my use only.

You may not link to any page of this site except by linking to the entire
page. You may not present any part of this site in a frame or &quot;sub-view&quot;
of another site without my express, written (on paper), permission.

You may not link &lt;img&gt; tags, or any other tags, such that my site is
supplying content for pages with a URL not on this site. Some of this site
is protected from this, but evidence that a part of the site is not so protected
is not to be construed as permission.

If you do view any content on this site, even if you do it only once,
you do so at your own risk, and you agree to give up all claims and rights,
legal or otherwise, against me or anyone associated with this site.

### Privacy:

You have none. Not from your neighbors. Not from your employer. Not from
your government. Not from anyone. So don't expect any from me.

Having said that, I will also say that at the time of this writing, I am
not actively collecting any information beyond logs supplied by the web server.
However, it is still up to you not to allow me access to any information you
wouldn't want me to have. Anything you send me, can/will be used against you.

### Nya!

So there.

If you would like to discuss any of this, you can contact me
and have a nice, calm, conversation about it.
